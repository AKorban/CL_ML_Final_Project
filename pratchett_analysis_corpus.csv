"It was the Law that, every tenth year, the people of all the tribes in the Dumii Empire should come and be Counted.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,0,['Law']
"They did not go all the way to the great capital city of Ware, but to the little walled town of Tregon Marus.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,1,[]
"The Counting was always a great occasion. Tregon Marus would double in size and importance overnight as tribal tents were pitched outside its walls. There was a horse market, and a five-day fair, old friends to be met, and a flood of news to be exchanged.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,2,['Tregon Marus']
"And there was the Counting itself. New names were added to the crackling scrolls which, the people like to believe, were taken to Ware, even to the Great Palace of the Emperor himself. The Dumii clerks laboriously wrote down how many pigs and goats and tromps everybody had, and one by one the people shuffled on to the next table and paid their taxes in furs and skins. That was the unpopular part. So the queue wound round Tregon Marus, in at the East Gate, through the postern and stables, across the market square, and through the countinghouse. Even the youngest babies were carried past the clerks, for the quill pens to wobble and scratch their names on the parchment. Many a tribesman got a funny name because a clerk didn't know how to spell, and there's more of that sort of thing in History than you might expect.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,3,['Tregon Marus']
"On the fifth day the Governor of the town called all the tribal chieftains to an audience in the market square, to hear their grievances. He didn't always do anything about them, but at least they got heard, and he nodded a lot, and everyone felt better about it at least until they got home. This is politics.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,4,[]
"And on the sixth day the people went back to their homes, along the roads the Dumii had built. They went east. Behind them the road went west, until it came to the city of Ware. There it was just one of the many roads that entered the city. Beyond Ware it became the West Road, becoming narrower and more winding until it reached the furthermost western outpost of Rug.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,6,['Ware']
Such was the Dumii Empire. It covered almost all of the Carpet from the Woodwall to the wasteland near Varnisholme in the north.,09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,7,[]
"In the west it bordered Wildland and the uttermost fringes of the Carpet, and southwards the roads ran as far as the Hearthlands. The painted people of the Wainscot, the warlike Hibbolgs, even the fire-worshippers of Rug, all paid their tribute to the Emperor.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,8,[]
"Some of them didn't like the Dumii much, usually because the Empire discouraged the small wars and cattle raids which, in the outlying regions, were by way of being a recreational activity. The Empire liked peace. It meant that people had enough time to earn money to pay their taxes. On the whole, peace seemed to work.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,9,[]
"So the Munrung tribe went east, and passed out of the chronicles of the Empire for another ten years. Sometimes they quarrelled among themselves, but on the whole they lived peacefully and avoided having much to do with history, which tends to get people killed.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,10,[]
"Old Grimm Orkson, chieftain of the Munrungs, had two sons. The eldest, Glurk, succeeded his father as chieftain when old Orkson died.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,12,"['Munrungs', 'Glurk', 'Orkson']"
"To the Munrung way of thinking, which was a slow and deliberate way, there couldn't have been a better choice. He looked just like a second edition of his father, from his broad shoulders to his great thick neck, the battering centre of his strength. Glurk could throw a spear further than anyone. He could wrestle with a snarg, and wore a necklace of their long yellow teeth to prove it. He could lift a horse with one hand, run all day without tiring, and creep up so close to a grazing animal that sometimes they'd die of shock before he had time to raise his spear. Admittedly he moved his lips when he was thinking, and the thoughts could be seen bumping against one another like dumplings in a stew, but he was not stupid. Not what you'd call stupid. His brain got there in the end. It just went the long way around.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,13,['Glurk']
"""He's a man of few words, and he doesn't know what either of them mean,"" people said, but not when he was within hearing.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,14,[]
"One day towards evening he was tramping homeward through the dusty glades, carrying a bone-tipped hunting spear under one arm. The other arm steadied the long pole that rested on his shoulder.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,15,[]
"In the middle of the pole, its legs tied together, dangled a snarg. At the other end of the pole was Snibril, Glurk's younger brother.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,16,[]
"Old Orkson had married early and lived long, so a wide gap filled by a string of daughters, that the chieftain had carefully married off to upright and respected and above all well-off Munrungs, separated the brothers.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,17,['Munrungs']
"Snibril was slight, especially compared with his brother. Grimm had sent him off to the strict Dumii school in Tregon Marus to become a clerk. ""He can't hardly hold a spear,"" he said, ""maybe a pen'd be better. Get some learning in the family.""",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,18,['Grimm']
"Most tribes had one, although Pismire was different. For one thing, he washed all the bits that showed at least once every month. This was unusual. Other shamen tended to encourage dirt, taking the view that the grubbier, the more magical.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,21,['Pismire']
"Other shamen ate the yellow-spotted mushrooms that were found deep in the hair thickets and said things like: ""Hiiiiya/iya/iheya! Heyaheyayahyah! Hngh! Hngh!"" which certainly sounded magical.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,23,[]
"Pismire said things like, ""Correct observation followed by meticulous deduction and the precise visualization of goals is vital to the success of any enterprise. Have you noticed the way the wild tromps always move around two days ahead of the sorath herds? Incidentally, don't eat the yellow-spotted mushrooms.""",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,24,['Pismire']
"Which didn't sound magical at all, but worked a lot better and conjured up good hunting. Privately some Munrungs thought good hunting was more due to their own skill. Pismire encouraged this view. ""Positive thinking,"" he would say, ""is also very important.""",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,25,['Pismire']
"He was also the official medicine man. He was a lot better, they agreed (but reluctantly, because the Munrungs respected tradition) than the last one they had had, whose idea of medicine was to throw some bones in the air and cry ""Hyahyahyah! Hgn! Hgn!"" Pismire just mixed various kinds of rare dust in a bowl, made it into pills, and said things like ""Take one of these when you go to bed at night and another one if you wake up in the morning.""",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,26,"['Munrungs', 'Pismire']"
"Grimm was chopping sticks outside his hut. ""It'll never work,"" said Pismire, appearing behind him in that silent way of his. ""You can't send Snibril off to Tregon again. He's a Munrung. No wonder he keeps running away. He'll never be a clerk. It's not in the blood, man. Let him stay. I'll see he learns to read.""",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,28,"['Pismire', 'Tregon']"
"""If you can learn him, you're welcome,"" said Grimm, shaking his head. ""He's a mystery to me. Spends all his time moping around. His mother used to be like that. Of course, she got a bit of sense once she got married.""",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,29,[]
"Grimm had never learned to read, but he had always been impressed by the clerks at Tregon Marus. They could make marks on bits of parchment that could remember things. That was power, of a sort. He was quite keen to see that an Orkson got some of it.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,30,[]
"So Snibril went to Pismire's village school with the other children, and learnt numbers, letters, and the Dumii laws. He enjoyed it, sucking in knowledge as though his life depended on it. It often did, Pismire said.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,31,"['Pismire', 'Pismire']"
"Glurk chased. Snibril watched. You don't have to chase around after creatures, Pismire had said. You watch them for long enough, and then you'll find the place to wait and they'll come to you. There's nearly always a better way of doing something.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,33,"['Glurk', 'Pismire']"
"When old Grimm died he was laid in a barrow dug out of the dust of the Carpet, with his hunting spear by his side. Munrungs had no idea where you went when you died, but there was no reason to go hungry once you got there.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,34,"['Grimm', 'Munrungs']"
"Glurk became chieftain, and would have to take the tribe to the next Counting. But the messenger to summon them to Tregon Marus was long overdue, and that worried Glurk. Not that he was in a hurry to pay taxes, and actually going to see why the messenger was late seemed a bit too, you know, keen, but usually the Dumii were very reliable, especially over tax-gathering.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,35,"['Glurk', 'Tregon Marus', 'Glurk']"
"But as he and his brother wandered homeward that evening he kept his thoughts to himself. Snibril grunted, and heaved the pole on to his other shoulder. He was shorter than his brother, and he was going to get shorter still, he thought, if he couldn't shed the load for a minute or two.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,36,[]
"""I feel as though my feet have worn right off and my legs have turned up at the ends,"" he said. ""Can't we stop for a rest? Five minutes won't hurt. And ... my head aches ... """,09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,37,[]
"They had reached the Dumii road, and not far north of it lay the Woodwall, home and supper. They sat down.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,39,['Woodwall']
"Glurk, who never wasted his time, started to sharpen the point of his spear on a piece of grit, but both brothers gazed down the road, shining in the dim evening air. The road stretched west, a glowing line in the darkness. The hairs around it were full of growing shadows. It had fascinated Snibril, ever since his father had told him that all roads led to Ware. So it was only the road that lay between the doorway of his hut and the threshold of the Emperor's palace, he thought. And if you counted all the streets and passages that led off the road ... Once you set foot on it you might end up anywhere and if you just sat by the road and waited, who might pass you by? Everywhere was connected to everywhere else, Pismire had said.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,40,"['Glurk', 'Ware', 'Pismire']"
"The Carpet had felt wrong too, today. The hunting had been hard. Most of the animals had vanished, and the dust between the hairs did not stir in the breathless air.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,42,[]
"There was a sound so loud as to be felt by the whole body, hitting the Carpet with horrible suddenness. The brothers sprawled in the dust as the hairs around them groaned and screamed in the gale.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,47,[]
"Glurk gripped the rough bark of a hair and hauled himself upright, straining against the storm that whipped round him. Far overhead the tip of the hair creaked and rattled, and all round the hairs waved like a grey sea. Smashing through them came grit, man-sized boulders half rolling and half flying before the wind.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,48,['Glurk']
"Holding on tightly with one hand, Glurk reached out with the other and hauled his brother to safety. Then they crouched, too shaken to speak, while the storm banged about them.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,49,['Glurk']
"When it appeared, it was riderless. Its ears lay back flat on its head and its eyes flashed green with terror. The white coat glistened with sweat, reins cracked across the saddle with the fury of the gallop.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,55,[]
"Snibril leapt in its path. Then, as the creature hurtled by him, he snatched at the reins, raced for a second by the pounding hooves, and flung himself up into the saddle. Why he dared that he never knew. Careful observation and precise determination of goals, probably. He just couldn't imagine not doing it.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,56,[]
"The village stockade had broken in several places, and grit boulders had smashed some huts. Glurk looked towards the Orkson hut and Snibril heard the moan that escaped from him. The chieftain climbed down from the horse's back and walked slowly towards his home.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,58,['Glurk']
"The rest of the tribe stopped talking and drew back, awed, to let him pass. A hair had fallen, a big one. It had crushed the stockade. And the tip of it lay across what was left of the Orkson hut, the arch of the doorway still standing bravely amid a litter of beams and thatch. Bertha Orkson came running forward with her children round her, and flung herself into his arms.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,60,['Bertha Orkson']
"He patted her absently but went on staring at the ruined hut. Then he climbed along up the mound of wreckage, and prodded about.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,62,[]
"So silent was the crowd that every sound he made echoed. There was a clink as he picked up the pot that had miraculously escaped destruction, and looked at it as though he had never seen its design before, turning it this way and that in the firelight. He raised it above his head and smashed it on the ground.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,63,[]
"Then he raised his fist above him and swore. He cursed by the hairs, by the dark caverns of Underlay, by the demons of the Floor, by the Weft and by the Warp. He bellowed the Unutterable Words and swore the oath of Retwatshud the Frugal, that cracked bone, or so it was said, although Pismire claimed that this was superstition.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,64,"['Retwatshud', 'Pismire']"
Curses circled up in the evening hairs and the night creatures of the Carpet listened. Oath was laid upon oath in a towering pillar vibrating terror.,09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,65,[]
"When he had finished the air trembled. He flopped down on the wreckage and sat with his head in his hands, and no-one dared approach. There were sidelong glances, and one or two people shook themselves and hurried away.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,66,[]
"""He shouldn't have said the Unutterable Words,"" said Pismire, more or less to himself, ""It's all superstition, of course, but that's not to say it isn't real. Oh, hello. I see you survived.""",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,68,['Pismire']
"""Doesn't mean it was untrue. I'm sure it was Fray. The changes in air pressure to begin with ... the animals sensed it ... just like it said in the ... "" He stopped. ""Just like I read somewhere,"" he said awkwardly.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,72,['Fray']
"Pismire walked to the horse and examined it carefully. ""It's Dumii, of course,"" he said. ""Someone fetch my herb box. Something's attacked him, see, here. Not deep but it should be dressed. A magnificent beast. Magnificent. No rider?""",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,76,"['Pismire', 'Dumii']"
"Pismire stroked the sleek coat. ""If you sold all the village and its people into slavery you might just be able to buy a horse like this. Whoever he belonged to, he ran away some time ago. He's been living wild for days.""",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,78,['Pismire']
"He let one leg go and paused to stare up at the hairs. ""Something scared him. Not Fray. Something days ago. It wasn't bandits, because they would have taken the horse too. And they don't leave claw marks. A snarg could have made that if it was three times its normal size. Oh, dear. And there are such,"" he said.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,83,[]
"To Snibril it seemed as though the night had grown a mouth and a voice. It came from the hairs just beyond the broken stockade, a mocking screech that split the darkness. The horse reared.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,85,[]
"On the further side there was a mounted shape in the darkness, and two pairs of eyes. One was a sullen red, one pair shimmered green. They stared unblinking over the flames at the villagers.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,88,[]
"""Nothing but a snarg,"" he growled, and threw. The spear struck something, but the green eyes only grew brighter. There was a deep, menacing rumble from an unseen throat.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,90,[]
"They blinked and were gone. With them went the spell. Cries went up and, ashamed of their fear, the hunters surged forward. ""Stop!"" shouted Pismire. ""Idiots! You'll chase out into the dark after that, with your bone spears? That was a black snarg. Not like the brown ones you get around here! You know the stories? They're from the furthest Corners! From the Unswept Regions!""",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,93,['Pismire']
"Prom the north, from the white cliff of the Woodwall itself, came again the cry of a snarg. This time it did not die away, but stopped abruptly.",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,94,[]
"Pismire stared north for a second, then turned to Glurk and Snibril. ""You have been found,"" he said. ""That was what brought this horse here, fear of the snargs. And fear of the snargs is nothing to be ashamed of. Fear of snargs like that is common sense. Now they have discovered the village you can't stay. They'll come every night until one night you won't fight back hard enough. Leave tomorrow. Even that might be too late.""",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,95,['Pismire']
"""Then trust me,"" said Pismire. ""And hope that you never do have to understand. Have you ever known me be wrong?""",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,99,['Pismire']
"""No. I suppose not."" Glurk looked worried. ""But we've never been frightened of snargs. We can deal with snargs. What's special about these?""",09_The Carpet People,0,CHAPTER 1,102,['Glurk']
"His possessions fitted easily into one fur pack, but he rummaged through them in case anything had been left behind. There was a bone knife with the carved wooden handle, and a spare pair of boots. Then there was a coil of bowstrings, and another bag of arrowheads, a piece of lucky dust and, right at the bottom, Snibril's fingers closed round a lumpy bag. He lifted it out carefully, taking care not to damage its contents, and opened it. Two, five, eight, nine. All there, their varnish catching the light as he moved his fingers.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,2,[]
"They had been shaped from the red wood of the Chairleg mines. On one side each coin carried a carving of the Emperor's head. They were Tarnerii, the coins of the Dumii, and they had cost many skins at Tregon Marus. In fact they were skins, if you looked at it like that, or pots or knives or spears. At least, so Pismire said.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,5,['Pismire']
"Snibril never quite understood this, but it seemed that so great was the Dumii's love for their Emperor they would give and take the little wooden pictures of him in exchange for skins and fur. At least, so Pismire said. Snibril wasn't sure that Pismire understood finance any more than he did.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,6,"['Dumii', 'Pismire', 'Pismire']"
The two of them made their way to the carts. It was less than a day since Fray had come. But what a day ...,09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,7,['Fray']
"Arguments, mostly. The richer Munrungs hadn't wanted to leave, especially since no-one had a clear idea of where they would go. And Pismire had gone off somewhere, on business of his own.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,8,"['Munrungs', 'Pismire']"
"Then, in the middle of the morning, they had heard snarg cries in the south. Someone saw shadows gliding among the hairs. Someone else said he saw eyes peering over the stockade.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,9,[]
"After that, the arguments stopped. The Munrungs were used to travelling, as people suddenly pointed out. They moved around every year or so, to better hunting grounds. They'd been planning this move for months, probably. It wasn't as if they were running away, everyone said. No-one could say they were running away. They were walking away. Quite slowly.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,10,['Munrungs']
"Before mid-afternoon the area inside the stockade was filled with carts, cows and people carrying furniture. Now the bustle was over, and they all waited for Glurk. His cart was the finest, a family heirloom, with a curved roof covered with furs. It needed four ponies to pull it; huts were things you built to last a year or so, but carts were what you handed down to your grandchildren.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,11,['Glurk']
"Behind it a string of pack ponies, laden with the Orkson wealth in furs, waited patiently. Then came the lesser carts, none as rich as the Orkson cart, though some almost equalled it. After them came the poorer handcarts, and the families that could only afford one pony and one-third shares in a cow. And last came the people on foot. It seemed to Snibril that those who carried all their personal goods in one hand looked a bit more cheerful than those who were leaving half theirs behind.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,12,[]
"""Isn't he here?"" said Glurk. ""Well, he knows we're going. He'll be along. I don't think he'd expect us to wait.""",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,14,['Glurk']
"""Well, tell him we'll be moving along towards Burnt End, along the old tracks,"" he said. ""Easy place to defend tonight, if it comes to it.""",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,17,[]
"Glurk waited until the last straggler had left the stockade, and then dragged the gate across. Anyone could get in through the broken walls, but Glurk still felt that the gates should be shut. That was more ... proper. It suggested that they might come back one day.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,18,"['Glurk', 'Glurk']"
"Snibril was trotting up the road ahead of the procession. He rode the white horse, a little inexpertly, but with determination. The horse had been named Roland, after an uncle. No-one questioned his right to name it, or to own it. The Munrungs, on the whole, agreed with Dumii laws, but finders-keepers was one of the oldest laws of all.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,19,"['Roland', 'Munrungs']"
"A little way on he turned off the road, and soon the dazzling white wooden cliff of the Woodwall rose above the hairs. Roland's hooves made no sound on the thick dust that lay about, and the Carpet closed in. Snibril felt the great immensity of it all around him stretching far beyond the furthermost limits of the Empire. And if the Dumii road might lead to distant places, where might this old track lead?",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,20,['Roland']
"He sat and watched it sometimes, on quiet nights. The Munrungs moved around a lot, but always in the same area. The road was always around, somewhere. Pismire talked about places like the Rug, the Hearth and the Edge. Faraway places with strange-sounding names. Pismire had been everywhere, seen things Snibril would never see. He told good stories.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,21,"['Munrungs', 'Pismire', 'Pismire']"
"Several times Snibril thought he heard other hooves nearby. Or were they black paws? Roland must have heard them too, for he trotted along smartly, always on the edge of a canter.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,22,['Roland']
"Dust had drifted up between the hairs here, forming deep mounds where herbs and ferns grew thickly and made the air heavy with their scent. The path seemed to grow drowsy, and wound aimlessly among the dust mounds for a while. It opened out into a clearing right by the south face of the Woodwall.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,23,[]
"It had dropped from the sky, many years before. It was a day's march long, and a good hour's walk wide. Half of it had been burned-unimaginably burned. Pismire said there had been one or two others, elsewhere in the far reaches of the Carpet, but he used the Dumii word: matchstick.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,24,['Pismire']
Pismire lived in a shack near the old wood quarry. There were a few pots lying around the door. Some thin half-wild goats skipped out of the way as Roland trotted into the clearing. Pismire was not there. Nor was his little pony.,09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,25,"['Pismire', 'Roland', 'Pismire']"
"But a freshly-tanned snarg skin was hanging by the cave. And someone was lying on a heap of ferns by a small fire, with his hat pulled down over his face. It was a high hat that might once have been blue, but time had turned it into a shapeless felt bag about the colour of smoke.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,26,[]
His clothes looked as though they had gathered themselves round him for warmth. A tattered brown cloak was rolled under his head as a pillow.,09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,27,[]
Snibril left Roland in the shade of the hairs and drew his knife. He crept towards the sleeper and made to raise his hat brim with the knifepoint.,09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,28,['Roland']
"There was a blur of activity. It ended with Snibril flat on his back, his own knife pressed to his throat, the stranger's tanned face inches from his own.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,29,[]
"""Well, by comparison to things like that,"" said the stranger, indicating the skin. ""Pismire said one of you might show up.""",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,34,['Pismire']
"He was clean-shaven, unusual in anyone but young Dumii boys, and his red-gold hair was bound up in a plait down his back. Although in some ways he did not appear much older than Snibril himself, his face was hard and lined except for his grin. At his belt hung a fierce-looking short sword, and there was a spear beside his pack.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,39,['Dumii']
"""I was following mouls,"" he said, and saw the blankness in Snibril's face. ""Creatures. From the Unswept Regions, originally. Nasty pieces of work. They ride around on these things.""",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,40,[]
"Then Pismire was with them, the rangy figure riding into the clearing, long legs almost touching the ground on either side of his pony. The old man showed no surprise that Snibril was there.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,44,['Pismire']
"""I mean fallen,"" said Pismire. ""Destroyed. The temples, the walls, everything. And snargs everywhere in the ruins. Fray has crushed the town. It was at the epicentre-right underneath,"" he went on wearily. ""It has been a long, horrible day. Where've the tribe gone? Burnt End? Good enough. Very defensible situation. Come on.""",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,46,"['Pismire', 'Fray']"
"""But what is Fray?"" said Snibril. ""I remember you telling stories about old times ... but that was long ago. Some kind of monster. Not something real.""",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,48,['Fray']
"""More like ... ways of telling things without having to do much explaining. Fray is some kind of force. There were people who used to know more, I think. There were old stories about old cities that suddenly vanished. Just legends, now. Oh, dear. So much gets forgotten. Written down and then lost.""",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,53,['Fray']
"The little old tracks that ran everywhere in the Carpet did not go straight, like the road, but wound in and out of the hairs like serpents. Any traveller who walked them, and few did, rarely met anyone else. Yet the paths were never overgrown. The Dumii said that they had been made by Peloon, the god of journeys. The Munrungs privately held that the Carpet itself had made them in some mysterious way, although they didn't say this in front of the Dumii. They didn't have any gods themselves but were generally polite about those belonging to other people.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,54,['Munrungs']
"Beneath the rugged tip of the Woodwall that was called Burnt End the track divided, going west and north. Glurk stopped his cart and looked up at the burnt, black crags. For a moment he thought he saw a movement high above. He sniffed the air.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,55,['Glurk']
"He jumped down from the cart and walked back along the track. There it was again, something scrambling away ... no, just a shadow. Glurk sniffed again, then shook himself. This was no way to behave, jumping at shadows. He cupped his hands round his mouth. ""Gather the carts round in a circle,"" he cried. ""We'll camp here.""",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,57,['Glurk']
"If you could put up with the unpleasantness and the ash, Burnt End was a safe place to be. The hairs had broken, when the Woodwall fell on to the Carpet, so there was not much cover for attackers. And the sheer white wood wall on one side reduced the chances of an attack. But the feel of the place was unsettling. Glurk bullied the tribe until the carts formed a wall, ponies and cattle penned inside. He ordered an armed man to sit on top of every cart, and set others to lighting fires and readying the camp for the night.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,58,['Glurk']
"Keep 'em busy. That was one of the three rules of being chief that old Grimm had passed on to him. Act confidently, never say ""I don't know"", and when all else fails, keep 'em busy. He'd hunted around Burnt End before, and the deathliness around the blackened wood could be unnerving even at the best of times. The only thing to do was work, laugh loudly or sing or march about with spears, before everyone's fears got the better of them.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,59,['Grimm']
"Soon, cooking fires sprang up within the ring. Glurk climbed on top of his cart, and peered back down the track. Fires got seen by ... things. Yet there was nothing like it to embolden the heart, and a hot meal did wonders for the courage. Were snargs out there? Well, they could deal with snargs. They had always been about, the nasty cowardly things. Snargs had just enough brains to know not to attack a village. They preferred to track the lone traveller, if the odds were high enough. Glurk didn't like the change.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,60,"['Snargs', 'Glurk']"
"After a while Glurk climbed down and took his hunting knife from under the seat. It was carved out of a snarg's thighbone and as good as a sword if it had to be. He thrust it into his belt, and accepted a bowl of soup from his wife.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,61,['Glurk']
"Night wore on, and the guards nodded. Outside the bright ring deeper shadows padded among the hairs ... and it seemed as though, around the ring of light, a darker ring had grown.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,62,[]
"They attacked to the south of the ring. There was a howl. Then a cart rocked. Its guard leapt for his life. It was Gurth, Glurk's eldest son.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,63,"['Gurth', 'Glurk']"
"""All arm! All arm! Hold the ring!"" cried Glurk, and leapt across the fire with a spear in either hand. One he hurled as he ran, and he heard it hit.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,64,['Glurk']
"These were not like the snargs he knew, came a cold thought out of his mind. They were daring to attack, and they carried men on their backs, or things like men at least, with green eyes and long teeth. For a moment Glurk hesitated, and an arrow grazed his arm.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,65,['Glurk']
"Glurk saw another cart go over, and then above him loomed a snarg with a shining collar. There was a roar, and a crash, and ... darkness spread along his arm, and drifted across his mind like nightfall.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,67,['Glurk']
"He stopped. Bane was drawing his sword. He dismounted quietly, and inched forward. With his free hand he motioned Pismire to go on talking.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,70,"['Bane', 'Pismire']"
"""And of course Ware is so nice at this time of year,"" said Pismire hurriedly, ""And there are many interesting byways and historic-""",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,71,"['Ware', 'Pismire']"
"Bane took one step forward, then whirled round and brought his sword whistling down into the shadows at his side. There was a grunt, and a body fell silently across the path, a crude black sword dropping from its hands.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,75,['Bane']
"Snibril gasped, and drew back. It wore armour of black leather, sewn with bone rings. At first sight the figure was manlike but when Snibril went closer he saw the hairy pelt and paws, and the long animal face.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,76,[]
"Before it had died away Snibril was in Roland's saddle and away, the others in close pursuit. There was shouting up ahead, and black shapes were moving across the light. As they entered the clearing and the broken ring of carts Snibril felt the horse bunch itself together for the leap.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,82,['Roland']
"He clung on tightly as they cleared a cart's roof with some inches to spare and landed, lightly, inside the ring. His arrival was hardly noticed in the battle that flowed around him.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,83,[]
"In one place the fallen carts were on fire, and that stopped the creatures. But some had broken through, and each was roaring at the people that slashed at it.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,84,[]
"Glurk lay still beneath one huge paw of a snarg, the biggest Snibril had ever seen. The great burning eyes moved, and saw Snibril. He wanted to run, but the horse did not budge. The rider on the snarg's back had also seen him. It grinned unpleasantly.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,85,['Glurk']
"Snibril slipped from the horse's back and picked up Glurk's spear. It was heavy-Glurk went in for spears that other people could barely lift, let alone throw. He held it cautiously, keeping the point aimed directly at the snarg.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,86,['Glurk']
The snarg and its rider turned to follow him as he moved around. He could see the huge creature tensing itself to spring.,09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,87,[]
"And he could see Roland. He'd sidled in a half circle, and now the snarg and its rider were behind the horse. Roland's tail twitched.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,88,"['Roland', 'Roland']"
"You should never have to chase prey, Pismire had always said. With proper observation and care, you should be waiting for them.",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,92,['Pismire']
"Snibril didn't even think. He left the butt end of the spear wedged in the ground, and held on tightly. The snarg realized that it had done something stupid when it was in mid-air, but by then it was too late, because it was hurling itself not at some weak creature but at a spearhead ...",09_The Carpet People,1,CHAPTER 2,93,[]
"When Snibril awoke the night was nearly past. He was lying by a dying fire, a pelt covering him. He felt warm and aching. He shut his eyes again, hurriedly.",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,0,[]
"""You're awake,"" said Bane, who was sitting with his back against a barrel and his hat, as usual, over his eyes. Roland was tethered to a nearby hair.",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,1,"['Bane', 'Roland']"
"""Oh yes. At least, what you would call all right. You Munrungs are difficult to kill. But plenty were injured, your brother the worst, I fear. Mouls rely on poison on their swords, and they cause a ... a sleep that you don't wake up from. Pismire is with him now. No, stay there. If anyone can cure him, then Pismire can. It won't help to have you under his feet. Besides,"" he added quickly, when he saw the look in Snibru's eyes, ""how about you? We had to pull you out from under that creature.""",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,3,"['Munrungs', 'Pismire', 'Pismire', 'Snibru']"
"Snibril murmured something, and looked around him. The camp was as peaceful as a camp could be, which was to say the early dawn was filled with noises and shouts, and the sounds of people. And they were cheerful sounds, with a note of defiance.",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,4,[]
"The attack had been beaten off. For a moment with first light glimmering in the hairs, the Munrungs felt in the mood to take on Fray and all his snargs. Some, like Bane, who never seemed to sleep, had stayed up by their fires, and early breakfasts were being cooked.",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,5,"['Munrungs', 'Fray', 'Bane']"
"Without saying a word Bane raked a bundle out of the ashes. Warm smells rose from it. ""Haunch of snarg, baked in its own juices,"" he said, slitting the burnt outer crust. ""I killed the owner myself, I'm pleased to say.""",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,6,['Bane']
"""Protein is where you find it. I will have a piece with no fat on it,"" said Pismire, stepping down from the Orkson cart.",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,7,['Pismire']
"Snibril saw the weariness in the old man's face. His herb bag lay beside him, almost empty. Pismire ate in silence for a while, and then wiped his mouth.",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,8,['Pismire']
"""He's as strong as a horse,"" he said in answer to their unspoken question. ""The gods of all large amiable creatures must have been present at his birth, whether he believes in them or not. He'll still be weak, though, until the poison has completely gone. He should stay in bed for at least two days, so I told Bertha six. Then he'll fret and bully her into letting him up the day after tomorrow, and feel a lot better for having outwitted me. Positive thinking, that's the style.""",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,9,['Bertha']
"He looked at Snibril. ""What about you? You might not have escaped half so easily. Oh, I know it's useless to say all this,"" he added, catching Bane's grin, ""but I wish that the people who sing about the deeds of heroes would think about the people who have to clear up after them.""",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,10,['Bane']
"He held up his herb bag. ""And with this,"" he said. ""Just different types of dust, a few useful plants. That's not medicine. That's just a way of keeping people amused while they're ill. We've lost such a lot.""",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,11,[]
"""Knowledge. Proper medicine. Books. Carpography. People get lazy. Empires, too. If you don't look after knowledge, it goes away. Look at this."" He threw down what looked like a belt, made up of seven different coloured squares, linked together with thongs.",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,13,[]
"""You see? A tribe. In the old days. The tribe. The first Carpet people. The ones who crossed the Tiles and brought back fire. They quarried wood at the Woodwall. They found out how to melt varnish off achairleg. Don't see them so much nowadays, but they used to be around a lot, pushing these big varnish-boilers from tribe to tribe, it's amazing the stuff they could make out of it ... Anyway, they used to make these belts. Seven different substances, you see. Carpet hair, bronze from the High Gate Land, varnish, wood, dust, sugar and grit. Every wight had to make one.""",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,16,['Tiles']
"""To prove they could. Mysticism. Of course, that was long ago. I haven't seen wights for years. And now their belts turn up as collars on these ... things. We've lost so much. We wrote too much down, and forgot it."" He shook his head. ""I'm going to have a nap. Wake me up when we leave."" He wandered off to one of the carts and pulled a blanket over his head.",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,18,[]
"Snibril watched him patting Roland absently on the muzzle. Who was Bane, if it came to that? He seemed to generate a feeling that made it hard to ask. He looked like a wild man, but there was something about him ... It seemed to Snibril that if a pot that was about to boil over had arms and legs, that would be Bane. Every move he made was deliberate and careful, as if he'd rehearsed it beforehand. Snibril wasn't sure if Bane was a friend. He hoped so. He'd be a terrible enemy.",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,24,"['Roland', 'Bane', 'Bane', 'Bane']"
"He lay back with the belt in his lap and thought of wights. Eventually he slept. At least, it seemed like sleep, but he thought that he could still hear the camp around him and see the outline of Burnt End across the clearing. But he wondered afterwards. It seemed like a dream. He saw, in a little blurred picture hanging in the smoke-scented air, the Carpet. He was flying through the hairs, well above the dust. It was night-time and very dark although, oddly enough, he could see quite clearly. He drifted over grazing herds, a group of hooded figures-wights!-pushing a cart, a sleeping village ... and then, as if he had been drawn to this spot, to a tiny figure walking among the hairs. As he drifted down towards it, it became a person, all in white. Everything about it was white. It turned and looked up at him, the first creature he had seen who seemed to know he was there ... and he sank towards those pale, watchful eyes ...",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,25,[]
"Glurk lay inside, white and shaken but strong enough to curse colourfully every time they went over a bump. Sometimes Fray rumbled far off in the south.",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,28,"['Glurk', 'Fray']"
"The Carpet was changing colour. That in itself was not strange. Around the Woodwall the hairs were dark green and grey, but west in Tregon Marus they were a light, dusty blue. Here the green was fading to yellow, and the hairs themselves were thicker and gnarled. Some bore fruit, large prickly balls that grew right out of the trunk of the hair.",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,30,['Woodwall']
Later they passed far under some kind of construction high in the hairs. Striped creatures peered down from their lofty fortress and hummed angrily as the carts passed beneath.,09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,32,[]
"""They're hymetors,"" called out Pismire, while the noise thrummed above their heads. ""Don't take any notice of them! They're peaceful enough if you leave them alone, but if they think you're after their honey they'll sting you!""",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,33,['Pismire']
"After that no-one as much as looked at a syrup ball, and Bane spent a lot of time glancing upwards with one hand on his sword.",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,36,['Bane']
"After a while they reached a place where two tracks crossed. A cairn of grit marked the crossroads. On the cairn, their packs at their feet, sat a man and a woman. They were ragged creatures; their clothes made Bane's clean tatters look like an Emperor's robe.",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,37,['Bane']
"""Camus Cadmes is my name,"" he said. ""I was a hair-cutter for the sawmill in Marus there. I suppose I'm still a hair-cutter now, too, if anyone wants to employ me. Hmm? Oh. I was out marking hairs for cutting and Lydia here had brought out my dinner and then there was this sort of heavy feeling and then-""",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,40,['Lydia']
"And then he'd got to a point where words weren't enough, and had to be replaced by arm-waving and a look of extreme terror.",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,41,[]
"""When we got back I don't think there was a yard of wall left standing. The houses just fell in on themselves. We did what we could but ... well, anyone who could just left. You can't rebuild from something like that. Then I heard the wolf things, and ... we ran.""",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,42,[]
"""Escape? From that? Maybe, those outside the walls. There was Barlen Corronson with us until yesterday. But he went after the syrup of those humming things, and they got him. Now we're going east. I've got family that way. I hope.""",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,45,[]
"They gave them new clothes and full packs, and sent them on their way. The couple hurried off, almost as fearful of the Munrungs as they were of the other sudden terrors of the Carpet.",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,46,['Munrungs']
"""Yes,"" said Bane looking down the west path with an odd expression. ""Even these."" He pointed, and there coming slowly up the path, was a heavy wagon drawn by a line of bent, plodding figures.",09_The Carpet People,2,CHAPTER 3,48,['Bane']
"Pismire showed no surprise. ""You've got one of their belts. You know when you really work hard at something, you're really putting yourself into your work? They mean it.""",09_The Carpet People,3,CHAPTER 4,2,['Pismire']
"The wight-drawn wagon rumbled on until it reached the cairn. Both parties looked across at the others. Then a small wight left the cart and walked across to Snibril and Bane. Close to, its robe could be seen to be, not just black, but covered in a crisscross of faint grey lines. The deep hood covered its face.",09_The Carpet People,3,CHAPTER 4,5,[]
"Snibril felt its steady gaze from the hidden eyes. And he felt the hardness of the belt rubbing into his back, and shifted uneasily. The wight turned its gaze on Bane. ""Tonight we eat the Feast of Bronze. You are invited. You will accept. Seven only. When the night-time fires are lit.""",09_The Carpet People,3,CHAPTER 4,12,['Bane']
"The wight turned on his heel and strode back to the wagon. ""Tonight?"" said Pismire. ""The Feast of Bronze? As if it was Feast of Sugar or Hair? Amazing. I thought they never invited strangers.""",09_The Carpet People,3,CHAPTER 4,14,['Pismire']

"""Wights? I thought they were just a children's story,"" Glurk said, after it had been explained to him. ""Still, it's a free meal. What's wrong with that? To tell the truth I don't know more'n a scrap about them, but I never heard of a bad wight.""",09_The Carpet People,3,CHAPTER 4,17,['Glurk']

It was a sight they'd remember for the rest of their lives, they said.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,45,"['Chrystobella', 'Pismire', 'Pismire']"
"This time she hurled out between the carts and into the hairs with a taunting bleat. Pismire scrambled after her, leapt down into the darkness, and tripped over her ...",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,46,['Pismire']
"That night ten men stood around the ring, their eyes tightly shut. Snibril was among them and he stood by Roland, who wore blinkers.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,51,['Roland']
"And they did it the next night, too. And the one after that, after a cow belonging to the widow Mulluck started to go ping when it should have gone 'mmmmmyaooooo'.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,52,['Mulluck']
"No-one wanted to move on. They didn't break camp but, without anyone actually giving any orders, brought the wagons into a tighter circle.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,53,[]
"And then, on the third night, Snibril was on guard by one of the carts, almost asleep, when he heard a shuffling noise behind him. Something big was in the bushes. He could hear it breathing.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,55,[]
"It's here, he thought. It's right behind me. If I turn around, I'll be turned to stone. But if I don't turn around, will I be turned to supper?",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,57,[]
"After a while the shuffling grew fainter, and he risked the briefest look. In the dim light he could see something bulky, at least twice as tall as he was, disappearing among the hairs.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,59,[]
"I ought to call everyone, he thought. But they'll run around and shout and give one another orders and trip over things, and then it will have long gone. But I've got to do something. Otherwise we'll soon have a statue that goes ping when it should go ""Hello"".",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,60,[]
"He found Roland, and quickly put his bridle on. There was no time for the saddle. And then he led the horse, very quietly in the direction of the jingling.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,61,['Roland']
"The termagant was so old that he could not remember a time when he'd been young. He could dimly remember when there had been other termagants, but he was strong then, and had driven them out.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,62,[]
"Later on there had been a people who had worshipped him and built a temple for him to live in, thinking that he was some kind of a god. They had worshipped him because he was so destructive, which is what often happens, but that sort of religion never works out in the long term; after he had turned many of them to statues the ones that were left had fled and left him in his temple.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,63,[]
He had no company now. Even the wild creatures kept away from the temple. In vain did he wander abroad and call out to his people in the south. There was no answer. He probably was the last termagant in the Carpet.,09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,64,[]
Sometimes he went to find some company. Anything would do. Just some other living things. He wouldn't even eat them. But it never worked. He only had to get near and they'd get stiff and cold and unfriendly for some reason.,09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,65,[]
"So he tramped back to his ruined temple, his tail dragging behind him. He was almost at the door before he smelt the smell, the forgotten smell of company.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,66,[]
"Snibril had reached the ruined temple just before. He felt Roland's hooves trot over hard wooden paving. Around him, lit by a faint glow, he could see fallen walls, littered with statues. Some were holding out boxes and bowing low, some were crouched back, hands to their eyes. There were small wild animals there, too ... unmoving.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,67,['Roland']
"In the centre of the temple there was a ruined altar, and that was the source of the glow. On it and around it were piled treasures. There were stones of salt and black jet, boxes of clear varnish and red wood, carved bone rings, crowns of bronze, all heaped anyhow.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,68,[]
"By the treasure was another statue. It was a small warrior, hardly half Snibru's height. Magnificent moustaches hung down almost to its waist. In one hand it held a sword and round shield, in the other a necklace of glittering salt crystals. Its face was turned up in an expression of surprise. A fluff creeper had crept across the floor to him, giving him a necklace of living red flowers.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,69,['Snibru']
"Someone else had tethered their mount there before him. It still stood there. It looked like a pony, but it was no larger than a Munrung dog, and had six legs.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,71,[]
"Snibril could have picked it up in both hands. There it stood, wearing a thin coat of dust. Roland lowered his head and sniffed at the still muzzle, puzzled. Snibril padded over to the mound of treasure and stared in awe. There were even coins there, not Tarnerii, but large wooden discs bearing strange signs. There were heavy swords, and chests of carved grit, set with salt gems. He stood and stared, and saw the warrior out of the corner of his eye.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,72,['Roland']
There was a jingling noise. Snibril saw a reflection in the statue's polished shield. It showed something scaly and very nearly shapeless.,09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,75,[]
The termagant jingled. Around its leathery neck were chains of varnish and red wood. Every claw was aglitter with rings. Bracelets were threaded on the scaly tail. Every time it moved its big beaked head it sent a little tinkling noise echoing round the temple.,09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,79,[]
"It peered at the altar and sniffed. Even in the shield the eyes frightened Snibril. They were large and misty blue, not frightening at all. Eyes you could get lost in, he thought, and turn to stone.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,80,[]
"Snibril's senses screamed at him to turn round and face the creature, but he stood still and thought desperately. The termagant began to jingle towards him.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,82,[]
"Snibril turned, holding the polished shield before his eyes. Under it he could see the termagant's feet scraping towards him. They were bony and clawed. And they didn't stop ...",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,83,[]
"It ought to have turned to stone. It saw itself! So much for bright ideas, he thought. And it was the only one I had.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,84,[]
"He started to back away. And then the termagant did stop. For it had seen another termagant. There, in the shield, a scaly green face looked back at it.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,85,[]
"A necklace hung over one ear. For a moment the creature had found company. Then, because he was shaking with fear, Snibril tilted the shield. The face vanished.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,86,[]
"After a moment of shocked silence the termagant let out a howl of anguish that echoed around the hairs. A massive foot stamped. Then the creature collapsed on the floor, put its paws over its eyes, and began to sob. Every now and then it'd drum its back feet on the floor. The sobs started at the tail end, by the look of it, and got bigger and bigger as they gulped their way up towards the mouth.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,87,[]
"Snibril watched the pool of tears spread out over the floor, and touch the statue of a hairhog by the wall. It twitched its nose. Wider and wider went the pool. Some statues awoke as it touched them, but some of the oldest, all covered in dust and creepers, stood unchanged. Little creatures swam valiantly to freedom between their ankles.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,89,[]
"Snibril scooped up the tears in the shield and splashed them over Roland. Then it was the turn of the little pony, which stared up at Snibril in amazement. He ran to the warrior by the treasure, and drenched him.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,90,['Roland']
"Nothing happened for a moment. An eyelid flickered. The hand with the necklace started to move. The little warrior was suddenly very much alive. He dropped the necklace and glowered at Snibril. ""Kone's Bones, where did you spring from?""",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,91,['Kone']
"""I don't know. This is the third year after the second Counting in the reign of the Emperor Targon at Ware,"" said Snibril.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,95,['Targon']
"""I'm not,"" said the little warrior, proudly. ""We don't Count. But I've heard of Targon. Before I came here it was the twenty-second year of his rule.""",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,98,[]
"""A year ... a year away,"" said the warrior. ""Far too long."" He bowed solemnly. ""A thousand pardons, stranger,"" he said. ""You shall be rewarded for this. I, Brocando, Son of Broc, Lord of Jeopard, King of the Deftmenes, promise you that. Yes. Rewarded.""",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,100,"['Brocando', 'Jeopard, King of the Deftmenes']"
"Brocando hesitated. ""You may be right,"" he said. ""There is no revenge on a witless beast. As for this ... "" he swept his arm over the shimmering heap, ""I have lost the taste for it. Let it lie here."" He sniffed. ""It is in my mind that such things as these are fit only for termagants. Mind you, that necklace looks rather ... no ... """,09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,108,['Brocando']
"Snibril had seen one or two items that he rather liked, and by the look of him Brocando could leave treasure behind because he had lots more at home, but he felt that it would look bad to argue.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,109,['Brocando']
"With a soft jingling the termagant raised its head and opened its eyes. Snibril went to lift his shield and it slipped out of his hands, rolling down the steps.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,110,[]
"To Snibril's amazement it began to coo at its reflection, and lay back again with the mirror cuddled in its arms. And then the termagant, with a clank, died peacefully in the temple that had been built for it time out of mind.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,112,[]
"Often, later, it was said by minstrels and wandering story-tellers that the termagant died when it caught sight of itself in the mirror. Never believe what you hear in songs. They put in any old thing if they think it sounds better. They said that its reflected glance turned it to a statue. But the death of the termagant was more complicated than that. Most things are.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,113,[]
"They dragged it up the steps and buried it under the altar stone. Snibril remembered Chrystobella and the other animals back at the camp, and collected some of the tear puddle into a small jewel-case from the heap. The remaining statues they left where they were.",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,114,['Chrystobella']
"""In the past they worshipped the termagants, so the story goes,"" said Brocando. ""They were a cruel race. Let them remain. For justice.""",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,115,['Brocando']
"""Actually ... "" Snibril began, as they rode away, ""I wouldn't mind just a small reward. If you happen to have one you want to give away. One you don't need.""",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,116,[]
"""My tribe needs somewhere to stay for a while. To repair the wagons, and so on. Somewhere where we don't have to look over our shoulders all the time.""",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,118,[]
"After a while, as they neared the Munrung's camp, Snibril said: ""You know, I don't think you've lost a year. If you were a statue, time couldn't have passed for you. In a way, you've gained a year. Everyone else is a year older, except you.""",09_The Carpet People,4,CHAPTER 5,122,[]
"They arrived at the camp just in time to stop the search party that was setting out. Brocando immediately became the centre of attention, something which he enjoyed and was obviously used to. Snibril was more or less forgotten. More or less ...",09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,0,['Brocando']
"""Well, never mind now,"" said Pismire. ""What's happening over there, now? Doesn't anyone of your muddle-headed people know how to welcome a king?""",09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,3,['Pismire']
"""I don't think so,"" said Snibril. ""He's quite brave and a bit excitable and doesn't really listen to what you say.""",09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,4,[]
"""There I was,"" he was saying. ""One step away from the treasure, when, jingle! There it was, behind me. So ... """,09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,7,[]
"Pismire elbowed his way through the crowd, removed his hat, bowed till his beard touched the ground, and stuck there, confronting a surprised Brocando with a tangle of white locks.",09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,8,"['Pismire', 'Brocando']"
"""Greeting, oh King,"" said the old man. ""Honoured are we that so great a son of so noble an ancestry should deem us worthy to ... er ... worthy. All we have is at your disposal, valiant sir. I am Pismire, a humble philosopher. This is ... """,09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,9,['Pismire']
"He snapped his fingers wildly at Glurk, who was standing open-mouthed at the spectacle of Pismire, still bent double in front of the dwarf warrior.",09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,10,['Glurk']
"Snibril saw Bane, standing at the back of the crowd with folded arms and a grim expression. He hadn't liked school in Tregon Marus, but he'd learned some things. The Dumii didn't like kings. They preferred Emperors, because they were easier to get rid of.",09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,15,['Bane']
And on the way back from the temple he'd asked Brocando what he'd meant when he said his people didn't Count. It meant they had nothing to do with the Dumii.,09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,16,['Brocando']
"""Hate them,"" Brocando had said, bluntly. ""I'd fight them because they straighten roads, and number things, and make maps of places that shouldn't be mapped. They turn everything into things to Count. They'd make the hairs of the carpet grow in rows if they could. And worst of all ... they obey orders. They'd rather obey orders than think. That's how their Empire works. Oh, they're fair enough, fair fighters in battle and all that sort of thing, but they don't know how to laugh and at the end of it all it's things in rows, and orders, and all the fun out of life.""",09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,17,['Brocando']
"At which point, Brocando amazed him. He walked up to Glurk and shook him warmly by the hand. When he spoke, it wasn't at all in the way he'd used in the temple. It was the kind of voice that keeps slapping you on the back all the time.",09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,19,['Brocando']
"""So you're the chieftain, are you?"" he said. ""Amazing! Your brother here told me all about you. It must be an incredibly difficult job. Highly skilled, too, I shouldn't wonder?""",09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,20,[]
"""I'm sure you do. I'm sure you do. Fascinating! And a terrible responsibility. Did you have to have some sort of special training?""",09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,22,[]
""" ... er ... no ... Dad died and they just gives me the spear and said, you're chief ... "" said Glurk.",09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,23,['Glurk']
"""Really? We shall have to have a serious chinwag about this later on,"" said Brocando. ""And this is Pismire, isn't it? Oh, do get up. I'm sure philosophers don't have to bow, what? Jolly good. And this must be ... General Baneus Catrix, I believe.""",09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,24,"['Brocando', 'Pismire', 'Baneus Catrix']"
"""Oh, yes,"" said Brocando. ""The Dumii kept sending armies to see us and suggest, most politely, that we submit and be part of their Empire. We always told them we didn't want to join. We weren't going to be Counted-""",09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,30,['Brocando']
"""Ah ... but we've always been quite good at defending ourselves,"" said Brocando, in a meaningful tone of voice. ""Against anyone."" He smiled.

"Snibril looked from one to the other. He realized he was holding his breath. He let it out. ""And then what happened?"" he said.",09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,36,[]
"Bane shrugged. ""I didn't attack,"" he said. ""I didn't see why good people should die. I went back and told the Emperor that Brocando's people would make better allies than unwilling subjects. Anyway, only a fool would attack that city.""",09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,37,"['Bane', 'Brocando']"
"Snibril took each of them by the shoulder. ""Anyway,"" he said, ""just because you're sworn enemies doesn't mean you can't be friends, does it?""",09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,47,[]
"When they were having the evening meal Glurk said to his wife: ""He's very gracious. Asked all about me. I've met a king. He's very important. He's called Protocol, I think.""",09_The Carpet People,5,CHAPTER 7,48,['Glurk']
"The people turned west. It was a cheerful journey to Jeopard, with Brocando riding by the leading cart. They were going somewhere that only a fool would attack.",09_The Carpet People,6,CHAPTER 8,0,['Brocando']
"Many of the Munrungs were frankly in awe of the small king, but Glurk was fast becoming an uncritical royalist. Brocando sensed his respectful audience, and chatted to him in that special way royalty has for commoners, which leaves the commoner feeling really cheered up without actually remembering very much about what was said to him.",09_The Carpet People,6,CHAPTER 8,1,"['Munrungs', 'Glurk', 'Brocando']"
"Snibril jogged along on the other side of the cart, listening with half an ear for any signs of Fray and half to the Deftmene's chatter. ""And then in the north wing of the palace my ancestor, Broc, built a temple to Kone the Founder. It took the wights seven years, carving pillars of varnish and wood and laying the great mosaic of the Carpet for Broc. We're still paying them for it. The walls were set with jet and salt, the altar of red wood inlaid with bronze. Really that was the centre of the present palace, which was built by my great-grandfather, the Seventh Broc, who added the Wood Gate when he was made king. And I mustn't forget the treasure rooms. I think there's at least nine. And only the reigning king may enter. Tarma the Woodcarver himself made the Crown. Seven pointy bits, with salt crystals on each one.""",09_The Carpet People,6,CHAPTER 8,2,"['Fray', 'Deftmene', 'Kone']"
"And so it went on, Glurk eagerly following the Deftmene through the treasury and the armoury, the banqueting halls and the guest bedrooms, while the carts got nearer and nearer to Jeopard.",09_The Carpet People,6,CHAPTER 8,4,['Glurk']
"Gradually the Carpet changed colour again, from red to deep purple and then dark blue. They camped under blue hairs, hunted the small shelled creatures that dwelt in dust holes, and wondered if Jeopard was as good as Brocando made out because if it was, it looked as though they'd better stop eating and drinking right now so as to leave room for the feasts they were going to have.",09_The Carpet People,6,CHAPTER 8,5,"['Jeopard', 'Brocando']"
"The track began to turn into a road, not a great white road like the Dumii built, but a neatly laid track of thick planks on a bank of dust. On either side the hairs grew thinner, and Snibril noticed many stumps. That was not all. No Munrung ever planted a seed. They liked vegetables when they could get them, and knew what grew where and which hairs dropped seeds that could be eaten, but except for Pismire's private herb garden everything that grew around them grew wild. The reason was quite obvious, to a Munrung: if you planted something you had to stop and watch it grow, fight off the animals and any hungry neighbour that happened to be passing, and generally spend your time, as Glurk put it, hanging around. Vegetables to a Munrung were something to give the meat a bit of a special taste.",09_The Carpet People,6,CHAPTER 8,6,"['Pismire', 'Glurk']"
"But in the blue land of Jabonya, around the little city of Jeopard, the Deftmenes had turned the Carpet into a garden. There were hairs there that even Pismire had not seen before, not the great sturdy trunks that crowded the rest of the Carpet, but delicate stems, their branches laden with fruit. Dust had been carefully banked up beneath them to make soil for all sorts of shrubs and vegetables. The travellers were shown ripe purple groads, that tasted of pepper and ginger, and big Master Mushrooms that could be dried and stored for years and still kept their delicate flavour. Even the track had been raised above the gardens, and small shrublike hairs grew along its border in a low hedge. It was an ordered land.",09_The Carpet People,6,CHAPTER 8,7,"['Pismire', 'Mushrooms']"
"""Where are the people?"" asked Glurk. ""I'll grant you that a nice baked root goes down well, but all this didn't grow by being whistled at. You're always having to hang about poking at the ground, when you're a farmer.""",09_The Carpet People,6,CHAPTER 8,12,['Glurk']
"There were no people. The fruit hung heavy in the bushes along the roadside, but there were none to pick it, except the Munrung children, who did it very well. But there was no-one else.",09_The Carpet People,6,CHAPTER 8,13,[]
"There was the silence made by something frightened, in fear of its life. There was the silence made by small creatures, being still. There was the silence made by big creatures, waiting to pounce on small creatures. Sometimes there was the silence made by no-one being there. And there was a very sharp, hot kind of silence made by someone there-watching.",09_The Carpet People,6,CHAPTER 8,15,[]
"Snibril crept towards the bush around one side of a hair. He could see it moving slightly. Bane was on the other side of it and Glurk, who could walk very quietly for such a big man, appeared as if by some kind of magic in front of it, with his spear raised.",09_The Carpet People,6,CHAPTER 8,27,"['bush', 'Bane', 'Glurk']"
"A small group of Deftmenes were labouring in the vegetable lines between the hairs. They did not look happy or, for that matter, very well-fed. Several guards were watching them. Even from here, Snibril could see the long snouts.",09_The Carpet People,6,CHAPTER 8,35,[]
"It was built on a piece of grit. The actual city was a cluster of buildings at the very top; a spiral roadway wound several times around the grit between the city and the floor. It had a gate at the bottom, but that was just for show. No-one could have got up that road if the people at the top didn't want them to.",09_The Carpet People,6,CHAPTER 8,37,[]

They brought red wood and sparkling varnish from achairleg to pave its streets; from the Hearthlands they led great caravans of the rare jet, to be made into domes and cornices, and cinder and ash for bricks and mortar; at the distant High Gate Land of the Vortgorns they traded their varnish wares for beaten bronze, for doors and pillars; salt and sugar, in great white crystals, were dragged between the hairs by teams of sweating horses, for walls and roofs.

"""Well ... "" said Snibril. What shall I say? Creatures from ancient tales live down there: thunorgs, the horrible delvers, and shadows without number or names.

"""Nothing's the matter,"" he said, in what he hoped was a voice full of leadership. ""Come on, lads. Last one in's a-""",09_The Carpet People,7,CHAPTER 9,43,[]

"Snibril tripped at the bottom of the stairs and landed on a pile of soft dust. Brocando was lighting a torch, taken from a rack of them on one wall of the little cave. One by one the band shuffled down. Brocando moved another lever and the statue trundled back over the hole, leaving them crowded shoulder to shoulder in the red-lit cave.",09_The Carpet People,7,CHAPTER 9,45,"['Brocando', 'Brocando']"
"The walls showed up brown in the torchlight, and were covered with tiny hairs that glittered as the light passed them. Sometimes they crossed the entrances to other tunnels. But there were no monsters, no sudden teeth ...",09_The Carpet People,7,CHAPTER 9,48,[]
"The path began to slope down and suddenly the light from Brocando's torch dimmed. Snibril started before he realized that they were entering a cavern under the Carpet, with walls so far away that the light was not reflected from them. They passed through many great caverns, the path narrowing and spiralling up around great columns of hair, so that they had to cling to stay on it. Sometimes the light sparkled on a distant wall. While they were edging along one place where the path narrowed almost to nothingness, and cold air rushed up from the depths below, Snibril slipped. Bane, who was next in line, reached out with great presence of mind and grabbed him by the hair just as he was about to totter into the darkness. But the torch slipped from his hands. They peered over the edge to watch it become a spark, then a speck and finally wink out. Something shifted in the dark depths of Underlay, and they heard it scuttle heavily away.",09_The Carpet People,7,CHAPTER 9,49,"['Brocando', 'Bane']"
"Anything else in the depths below would hardly have seen them, little specks inching along the roots of the hairs. Eventually Brocando called a halt on the edge of another abyss. There was a narrow bridge stretching across it, and Snibril could just make out a door on the far side.",09_The Carpet People,7,CHAPTER 9,54,['Brocando']
"""You are the only people apart from the kings of Jeopard to see this,"" Brocando went on. ""After the secret passage was dug, Broc had all the workers personally put to death to stop the secret escaping.""",09_The Carpet People,7,CHAPTER 9,57,['Brocando']
"When they had crossed the bridge Brocando pushed the little wooden door open, revealing a spiral staircase lit by green light filtering down from a tiny circle of light. It was a long climb up the winding staircase, which was so narrow that the boots of the ones in front tangled with the hands of the ones behind, and the torches made flickering shadows of giant warriors against the walls. Ghostly as it was, Snibril welcomed it. He hated the darkness under the Carpet.",09_The Carpet People,7,CHAPTER 9,61,['Brocando']
"Before it reached the circle of green light the stairway opened on to a little landing, just big enough to hold them all. There was another door in the wall.",09_The Carpet People,7,CHAPTER 9,62,[]
"""And now we need another hundred,"" said a soft voice that made Snibril's hair prickle. ""I advise you to sign this paper, your majesty, and my guards will gather together this hundred and be gone. They will not be slaves. Just ... assistants.""",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,3,[]
"""But you are the king,"" said the second voice. ""It must be right, if the king says so. Everything signed and proper.""",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,5,[]

"""Jornarileesh! You think they care what is done here?"" Second Voice purred. ""Sign! Or perhaps Gorash here can find some other use for your hands?""",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,14,['Gorash']
"""That's my brother,"" he said. ""Such as he is. Here's the plan. We rush in, and we kill as many mouls as possible.""",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,17,[]
"""Let's start now, then,"" said Brocando. He put his foot against the door and pushed. It moved a fraction, and then stopped.",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,25,['Brocando']
"Snibril saw a throne lying on the floor. It had blocked the door. Now it lay halfway down the steps and a thin Deftmene was struggling underneath it, making pathetic little noises. Beyond it two mouls were standing, staring at the open doorway. One was big, wide-shouldered, with a pale face almost hidden in his leather helmet. He held a coiled whip in one great paw. Voice Three, Snibril thought. He even looks as though he should be called Gorash. Beside him stood a thin moul wearing a long black cloak and a grin like a wolf that's just had dinner. Voice Two, said Snibril to himself. He looks like he ought to have a name with a lot of esses in it-something you can hiss.",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,30,"['Deftmene', 'Gorash']"
"Then Brocando whirred forward like an enraged chicken, waving his sword. The thin moul leapt backwards and drew its own sword with disheartening swiftness. Gorash uncurled his whip, but found that Bane was suddenly between him and the king.",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,32,"['Brocando', 'Gorash', 'Bane']"
"The Munrungs watched. There seemed to be two ways of swordfighting. Brocando went at it like a windmill, pushing the enemy back by sheer effort. Bane fought quietly, like some kind of machine-tamp, thrust, parry ... tic toe tic.",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,33,"['Munrungs', 'Brocando', 'Bane']"
"Snibril found that spears fought well against swords, if you didn't throw them. They could prod, and they could parry. And as more guards poured into the room, he realized that it also helped if you were outnumbered. It made it easier to hit an enemy, for one thing. And since there were so many of them, each one wasn't too keen to get involved, taking the view that there was no point in running risks when there were all these other people to do it for them.",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,40,[]
"This must be how the Deftmenes think, he told himself as he broke a spear over the head of a moul. Always pick a bigger enemy, because he's easier to hit ...",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,41,[]
"He found himself pressed up against the back of Bane, who was still fighting in his tictoc way, like someone who can do it all day.",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,42,['Bane']
And then it was over. The few remaining guards fell over one another to get out of the door. Gorash was dead. The skinny moul dodged a last wild slash from Brocando's sword and dived through the open doorway to the secret passage. They heard it running down the steps.,09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,49,"['Gorash', 'Brocando']"
"It took three of them to lift it up. Underneath it was Antiroc, who hung limply from Glurk's grip as he was hauled to his feet.",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,59,"['Antiroc', 'Glurk']"
"""Give me the crown,"" said Brocando, in deadly tones. ""It's the thing on your head. The thing that doesn't belong to you.""",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,60,['Brocando']
"There was a commotion outside. A moul backed through, with an arrow sticking in it. Half a dozen Deftmenes charged over it. They hardly glanced at Brocando, but bore down with grim determination on Antiroc, who was snatched from Glurk's grasp and hustled towards the balcony.",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,64,"['Brocando', 'Glurk']"
"Four Deftmenes had hold of Antiroc's arms and legs, and were swinging him backwards and forwards, high over the roofs of Jeopard. ""A-one-a-two-a-three,"" they chanted, the swings getting larger.",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,66,['Antiroc']
"""Hmm? Oh, all right. Put him down, people,"" said Brocando. ""Come on. Release him. I won't say let him go, you might get the wrong idea. I can't have you subjects throwing my family over the balcony, that would never do.""",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,69,['Brocando']
"""Just joking,"" said Brocando, who didn't look it. ""Blast all this ... beholden to other people. You'll get me feeling guilty for throwing traitors off the rock now. It's a royal tradition. All right, then. He can go.""",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,73,['Brocando']
"""All those people whose relatives you sold to the mouls?"" said Brocando. ""Dear me. Of course, you can follow your friend ... """,09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,75,['Brocando']
"""Was that his name? Right sort of name,"" said Brocando. ""You can talk about old times."" He nodded to the four who had been about to de-balcony the usurper. ""If he won't go, give him a helping hand,"" he said.",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,78,['Brocando']
"The Deftmenes advanced on Antiroc, murder in their eyes. He looked imploringly at Brocando, hesitated for a moment, and then dashed for the doorway.",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,79,['Brocando']
"""He can kill Gormaleesh or Gormaleesh can kill him, for all I care. Or he can even find his way out,"" sighed Brocando. ""But now ... let's round up the last of the mouls. I shouldn't think they'll put up much of a fight now.""",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,81,['Brocando']
"Brocando looked tired. ""Well, we haven't got many dungeons,"" he said. ""So perhaps if you can avoid capturing any alive that would help.""",09_The Carpet People,8,CHAPTER 10,83,['Brocando']
"Snibril sat outside the palace stables, watching Roland investigate the contents of a nosebag. Loose boxes built for the Deftmenes' little six-legged beasts were too small for him, and he had to be tethered in the yard with the carts. He stood there patiently chewing, and made a lighter shadow in the darkness.",09_The Carpet People,9,CHAPTER 11,0,['Roland']
"Snibril could hear the celebrations going on in the main hall. If he concentrated, he could just hear Pismire playing the fluteharp; it was easy to tell, even with all the other instruments in the Deftmenes' own band, by the way the notes went all over the place without ever hitting the tune. Pismire always said there were some things you should care about enough to do badly.",09_The Carpet People,9,CHAPTER 11,1,"['Pismire', 'Pismire']"
"When Snibril had wandered out Glurk had been delighting everybody by lifting twenty Deftmene children on a bench, and carrying them around the hall.

"""Well, here we are,"" said Snibril, ""and can't even remember which direction our old village lies in. Brocando says we can stay here as long as we like. Forever, even. Safe and sound.

And my ears hurt.""",09_The Carpet People,9,CHAPTER 11,5,"['Brocando', 'Bane', 'Ware']"
"It's a big Carpet, he thought. Brocando and Bane are both ... well, likeable, but they look at the world from opposite ends. Look at the Dumii. Half the time you can see why the Deftmenes don't like them. They're so fair about things, in an unimaginative way. And in their unimaginative way, fighting like tictoc men, they built a huge Empire. And Bane hates the idea of kings. But the Deftmenes fight as if they enjoy it, and make up life as they go along, and they'll do anything for their king. You can't expect them to get along with each other-",09_The Carpet People,9,CHAPTER 11,6,"['Brocando', 'Bane', 'Bane']"
He felt a pricking sensation in his feet. The headache was felt like a fire now. The silent Carpet seemed to be waiting ...,09_The Carpet People,9,CHAPTER 11,8,[]

They scrambled among thick roots and crept around holes so deep that a warm wind rushed up from them.",09_The Carpet People,9,CHAPTER 11,74,[]

"A moment later the hand appeared by the snarg, and started untethering it. It looked up, and with horror Pismire saw its eyes narrow. Before it could growl, though, the hand bunched up into a knotted fist and smacked it smartly between the eyes. He heard the creature give a little sigh, and saw it fall over slowly. Before it reached the ground the tether tightened and tugged it into the bush.",09_The Carpet People,9,CHAPTER 11,129,"['Pismire', 'bush']"
"All that night they journeyed south. Most of the pack were mounted on their snargs, though the prisoners and their guards had to run along in the middle of the jostling bodies. Dawn came. The hairs around had changed from deep purple to red again.",09_The Carpet People,10,CHAPTER 12,0,['Dawn']

A man stood at each corner. Each one was as tall as Bane. They wore helmets and body armour of beaten bronze, and carried by their sides long bronze swords. Their shields were bronze, round like the High Gate Land itself, and their hair was the colour of the metal. They had short square beards, and grey eyes that stared calmly ahead of them.

"""I'm going to Ware,"" he told the tribe that evening. They looked at him in horror. Technically, Glurk was still chief ... if he was alive. If he wasn't, then Snibril was chief.

"The wights didn't carry weapons, but they did carry tools. And a hammer is a weapon, if you hit a head instead of a nail.

"They went by narrow tracks that wound in and out of overgrown thickets. In some places enormous hairs had fallen over the path.

"It was not on any maps of the Carpet. For some time they had been walking through its overgrown streets, not realizing they were streets, until they found the statues. Little blue dust flowers grew on them, and fluff had planted itself around them, but they still stood in the centre of their lost city. They had been four kings; wooden crowns were on their wooden heads and they each pointed with one arm to a different point of the compass. Ferns grew around their feet, and small creatures had made their homes in crooks of arms and folds of carven clothing.",09_The Carpet People,14,CHAPTER 16,3,[]
"Around them, when you knew what you were looking for in the way the hairs grew and dust mounds were banked, was the city. Age hung upon it like smoke. Thick hairs grew in the ruins of buildings, dust had filled the streets. Creepers and tendrils had done their work, breaking down walls and venturing into hidden walls. Insects chirruped in broken archways. Hair pollen made the air sparkle.",09_The Carpet People,14,CHAPTER 16,4,[]

"Snibril was led past groups of sullen soldiers to a heavy-set man who was sitting on the ground. One arm was in a sling, and his face was pale.

Snibril found that he was in command; the Munrungs wanted to follow him, the Deftmenes were beginning to think that anyone who could lose their temper that badly was probably a king, and the Dumii-well, the Dumii soldiers followed Sergeant Careus, and Sergeant Careus was riding alongside Snibril.

"Ware had been built between and round five giant hairs. There were really three cities, ringed one inside the other. Inside the thick outer walls was Imperial Ware, a city of wide avenues paved with wood and salt, lined with statues, a city of impressive vistas and magnificent buildings, and at every turn monuments to old battles and glorious victories and even one or two defeats of the more glorious sort.",09_The Carpet People,16,CHAPTER 18,0,[]
"Few people actually lived in Imperial Ware, except a few caretakers and gardeners and dozens of sculptors. It was a city for looking at, not living in.",09_The Carpet People,16,CHAPTER 18,1,[]
"Outside it, separated by a wall of sharpened hair stakes, was Merchants' Ware, the city most people thought of as the real city. Normally its narrow streets were crowded with stalls, and people from all over the Carpet. They'd all be trying to cheat one another in that open-and-above-board way known as 'doing business'. All sorts of languages could be heard, often very loudly. Ware was where people came to trade.",09_The Carpet People,16,CHAPTER 18,2,['Ware']
"The Dumii had built their Empire with swords, but they kept it with money. They'd invented money. Before money, people had bought things with cows and pigs, which were not very efficient for the purpose because you had to feed them and keep them safe all the time and sometimes they died. And suddenly the Dumii turned up with this money stuff, which was small and easy to keep and you could hide it in a sock under the mattress, which hardly ever worked with cows and pigs. And it could be cows or pigs. Also, it had little pictures of Emperors and things on it, which were interesting to look at. At least, more interesting than cows and pigs.",09_The Carpet People,16,CHAPTER 18,3,['Dumii']
"And, Pismire had once said, that was how the Dumii kept their Empire. Because once you started using Dumii money, which was so easy and convenient and didn't moo all night, you started saving up for things, and selling things in the nearest market town, and settling down, and not hitting neighbouring tribes as often as you used to. And you could buy things in the markets that you'd never seen before - coloured cloth, and different kinds of fruit, and books. Pretty soon, you were doing things the Dumii way, because it made life better. Oh, you went on about how much better life was in the old days, before there was all this money and peacefulness around, and how much more enjoyable things were when people used to get heavily-armed in the evenings and go out and make their own entertainment-but no-one was anxious actually to go back there.",09_The Carpet People,16,CHAPTER 18,4,['Pismire']
"""Economic imperialism!"" Pismire had once said, picking up a handful of coins. ""A marvellous idea. So neat and simple. Once you set it going, it works all by itself.

Amazing!""",09_The Carpet People,16,CHAPTER 18,5,['Pismire']

"The shape and cosmology of the disc system are perhaps worthy of note at this point. There are, of course, two major directions on the disc: Hubward and Rimward. But since the disc itself revolves at the rate of once every eight hundred days (in order to distribute the weight fairly upon its supportive pachyderms, according to Reforgule of Krull) there are also two lesser directions, which are Turnwise and Widdershins.: #c_46 Since the discs tiny orbiting sunlet maintains a fixed orbit while the majestic disc turns slowly beneath it, it will be readily deduced that a disc year consists of not four but eight seasons. The summers are those times when the sun rises or sets at the nearest point on the Rim, the winters those occasions when it rises or sets at a point around ninety degrees along the circumference. Thus, in the lands around the Circle Sea, the year begins on Hogs Watch Night, progresses through a Spring Prime to its first midsummer (Small Gods Eve) which is followed by Autumn Prime and, straddling the half-year point of Crueltide, Winter Secundus (also known as the Spindlewinter, since at this time the sun rises in the direction of spin). Then comes Secundus Spring with Summer Two on its heels, the three quarter mark of the year being the night of Alls Fallowthe one night of the year, according to legend, when witches and warlocks stay in bed.

Tiffany's mother used to tell him not to speak like that, although the Baron was always very respectful to Mr Aching since Granny had died two years ago, calling him the finest shepherd in these hills, and was generally held by the people in the village to be not too bad these days.

And for that reason she didn't wear any occult jewellery, or have a glowing magical knife or a silver goblet with a pattern of skulls all round it, or carry a broomstick with sparks coming out of it, all of which are tiny hints that there may be a witch around. Her pockets never carried anything more magical than a few twigs, maybe a piece of string, a coin or two and, of course, a lucky charm.",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,106,['Tick']
"Everyone in the country carried lucky charms, and Miss Tick had worked out that if you didn't have one people would suspect that you were a witch. You had to be a bit cunning to be a witch.",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,107,['Tick']
"Miss Tick did have a pointy hat, but it was a stealth hat and only pointed when she wanted it to.",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,108,['Tick']
"The only thing in her bag that might have made anyone suspicious was a very small, grubby booklet entitled 'An Introduction to Escapology', by The Great Williamson. If one of the risks of your job is being thrown into a pond with your hands tied together, then the ability to swim thirty yards under water, fully clothed, plus the ability to lurk under the weeds breathing air through a hollow reed counts as nothing if you aren't also amazingly good with knots.",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,109,[]
"She looked up at the sounds of jingling. A strange procession was coming up the white road. It was mostly made up of donkeys pulling small carts with brightly painted covers on them. People walked alongside the carts, dusty to the waist. They were mostly men, they wore bright robesor robes, at least, that had been bright before being trailed through mud and dust for yearsand every one of them wore a strange black square hat.",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,112,[]
"They looked like tinkers, but there wasn't one amongst them, she knew, who could mend a kettle. What they did was sell invisible things. And after they'd sold what they had, they still had it. They sold what everyone needed but often didn't want. They sold the key to the universe to people who didn't even know it was locked.",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,114,[]
"There was bread and jam for lunch. Her mother said: 'The teachers are coming to town today. You can go, if you've done your chores.'",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,117,[]
"'Then you can have half a dozen carrots and an egg. I dare say they could do with an egg, poor things,' said her mother.",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,119,[]
"Most boys in the village grew up to do the same jobs as their fathers or, at least, some other job somewhere in the village where someone's father would teach them as they went along. The girls were expected to grow up to be somebody's wife. They were also expected to be able to read and write, those being considered soft indoor jobs that were too fiddly for the boys.",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,121,[]
"However, everyone also felt that there were a few other things that even the boys ought to know, to stop them wasting time wondering about details like 'What's on the other side of the mountains?' and 'How come rain falls out of the sky?'",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,122,[]
"Every family in the village bought a copy of the Almanack every year, and a sort of education came from that. It was big and thick and printed somewhere far off, and it had lots of details about things like phases of the moon and the right time to plant beans. It also contained a few prophecies about the coming year, and mentioned faraway places with names like Klatch and Hersheba. Tiffany had seen a picture of Klatch in the Almanack. It showed a camel standing in a desert. She'd only found out what both those things were because her mother had told her. And that was Klatch, a camel in a desert. She'd wondered if there wasn't a bit more to it, but it seemed that 'Klatch = camel, desert' was all anyone knew.",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,123,"['Klatch', 'Klatch']"
"The teachers were useful there. Bands of them wandered through the mountains, along with the tinkers, portable blacksmiths, miracle medicine men, cloth pedlars, fortune-tellers and all the other travellers who sold things people didn't need every day but occasionally found useful.",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,125,[]
"They went from village to village delivering short lessons on many subjects. They kept apart from the other travellers, and were quite mysterious in their ragged robes and strange square hats. They used long words, like 'corrugated iron'. They lived rough lives, surviving on what food they could earn from giving lessons to anyone who would listen. When no one would listen, they lived on baked hedgehog. They went to sleep under the stars, which the maths teachers would count, the astronomy teachers would measure and the literature teachers would name. The geography teachers got lost in the woods and fell into bear traps.",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,126,[]
"People were usually quite pleased to see them. They taught children enough to shut them up, which was the main thing after all. But they always had to be driven out of the villages by nightfall in case they stole chickens.",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,127,[]
Today the brightly coloured little booths and tents were pitched in a field just outside the village. Behind them small square areas had been fenced off with high canvas walls and were patrolled by apprentice teachers looking for anyone trying to overhear Education without paying. The first tent Tiffany saw had a sign which said:,13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,128,[]
"Tiffany had read enough to know that, while he might be a whiz at major land masses, this particular teacher could have done with some help from the man running the stall next door:",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,129,[]
"The next stall along was decorated with scenes out of history, generally of kings cutting one another's heads off and similar interesting highlights. The teacher in front was dressed in ragged red robes, with rabbitskin trimmings, and wore an old top hat with flags stuck in it. He had a small megaphone which he aimed at Tiffany.",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,130,[]
"'Oh, you've got to know where you've come from, miss,' said the teacher. 'Otherwise how will you know where you're going?'",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,133,[]
"She found what she was looking for at a booth hung with pictures of animals including, she was pleased to see, a camel.",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,135,[]
"She wondered how useful the thing in the river had been, but this looked like the only place to find out. A few children were waiting on the benches inside the booth for the lesson to begin, but the teacher was still standing out in front, in the hope of filling up the empty spaces.",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,137,[]
"'Hello, little girl,' he said, which was only his first big mistake. 'I'm sure you want to know all about hedgehogs, eh?'",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,138,[]
"The teacher's eyes narrowed further. Children like Tiffany were bad news. 'I can see you're a clever one,' he said. 'But I don't know any teachers of zoology in these parts. Vetin'ry, yes, but not zoology. Any particular animal?'",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,146,"[""Vetin'ry""]"
"'What size of soup plates? Do you mean big soup plates, a whole full portion bowl with maybe some biscuits, possibly even a bread roll, or do you mean the little cup you might get if, for example, you just ordered soup and a salad?'",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,148,[]
"The size of soup plates that are eight inches across,' said Tiffany, who'd never ordered soup and a salad anywhere in her life. 'I checked.'",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,149,[]
"'Hmm, that is a puzzler,' said the teacher. 'Don't think I know that one. It's certainly not useful, I know that. It sounds made-up to me.'",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,150,[]
"The teacher jerked his thumb towards a little tent at the end of the row. It was black and quite shabby. There weren't any posters, and absolutely no exclamation marks.",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,153,[]
"'Couldn't say,' said the teacher. 'She says it's thinking, but I don't know how you teach that. That'll be one carrot, thank you.'",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,155,[]
"When she went closer Tiffany saw a small notice pinned to the outside of the tent. It said, in letters which whispered rather than shouted:",13_The Wee Free Men,0,Chapter 1A Clang Well Done,156,[]
"She pushed aside the flap. It was dark inside the tent, as well as stuffy and hot. A skinny figure sat behind a small table. She had a very sharp, thin nose and was wearing a large black straw hat with paper flowers on it. It was completely unsuitable for a face like that.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,7,[]
"'What a strange question to spring on someone,' said the woman, looking slightly shocked. 'Your baron bans witches in this country, you know that, and the first thing you say to me is ""Are you a witch?"" Why would I be a witch?'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,9,[]
"'Yes, but witches are also very clever,' said Tiffany calmly. There was something about the twinkle in the woman's eyes that told her to carry on. 'They sneak about. Probably they often don't look like witches. And a witch coming here would know about the Baron and so she'd wear the kind of hat that everyone knows witches don't wear.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,14,"['Tiffany', 'Baron']"
"The woman stared at her. 'That was an incredible feat of reasoning,' she said at last. 'You'd make a good witch-finder. You know they used to set fire to witches? Whatever kind of hat I've got on, you'd say it proves I'm a witch, yes?'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,15,[]
"Again, there was a pause while the woman gave Tiffany a long stare, as if making up her mind about something.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,25,[]
"'My name,' she said at last, 'is Miss Tick. And I am a witch. It's a good name for a witch, of course.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,26,[]
"'Oh, you mean a pune, or play on words,' said Tiffany.[Tiffany had read lots of words in the dictionary that she'd never heard spoken, so she had to guess at how they were pronounced.] 'In that case it would be even better if you were Miss Teak, a hard foreign wood, because that would sound like ""mystique"", or you could be Miss Take, which would'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,31,"['Miss Teak', 'Miss Take']"
"'I can see we're going to get along like a house on fire,' said Miss Tick. 'There may be no survivors.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,32,['Tick']
"'Oh, pur-lease,' said Miss Tick. 'Yes, yes, I am a witch. I have a talking animal, a tendency to correct other people's pronunciationit's pun, by the way, not ""pune""and a fascination for poking my nose into other people's affairs and, yes, a pointy hat.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,34,['Tick']
"There was a click, and a slow thwap-thwap noise, and the centre of the hat rose slowly and jerkily up out of the paper flowers, which fell away.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,38,[]
"'Because you haven't the slightest desire to do so,' said Miss Tick. 'You're absolutely fascinated. You want to be a witch, am I right? You probably want to fly on a broomstick, yes?'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,43,['Tick']
"'Really? You like having to wear really, really thick pants? Believe me, if I've got to fly I wear two pairs of woollen ones and a canvas pair on the outside which, I may tell you, are not very feminine no matter how much lace you sew on. It can get cold up there. People forget that. And then there's the bristles. Don't ask me about the bristles. I will not talk about the bristles.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,45,[]
"'I could. But a witch doesn't do that sort of thing. Once you use magic to keep yourself warm, then you'll start using it for other things.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,47,[]
"'Once you learn about magic, I mean really learn about magic, learn everything you can learn about magic, then you've got the most important lesson still to learn,' said Miss Tick.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,49,[]
'Not to use it. Witches don't use magic unless they really have to. It's hard work and difficult to control. We do other things. A witch pays attention to everything that's going on. A witch uses her head. A witch is sure of herself. A witch always has a piece of string',13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,51,[]
"'Good. Although there's more to witchcraft than string. A witch delights in small details. A witch sees through things and round things. A witch sees further than most. A witch sees things from the other side. A witch knows where she is, and when she is. A witch would see Jenny Green-Teeth,' she added. 'What happened?'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,53,['Jenny Green-Teeth']
"Tiffany looked around the tent. There wasn't much to see, even now that her eyes were getting accustomed to the gloom. The sounds of the outside world filtered through the heavy material.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,56,[]
"'Correct. I just used my ears,' said Miss Tick, saying nothing at all about saucers of ink. 'Tell me about this monster with eyes the size of the kind of soup plates that are eight inches across. Where do soup plates come into it?'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,60,['Tick']
"'The monster is mentioned in a book of stories I've got,' explained Tiffany. 'It said Jenny Green-Teeth has eyes the size of soup plates. There's a picture, but it's not a good one. So I measured a soup plate, so I could be exact.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,61,"['Tiffany', 'Jenny Green-Teeth']"
"Tiffany told her about the fight with Jenny, although she didn't mention Wentworth in case Miss Tick got funny about it. Miss Tick listened carefully.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,65,"['Jenny', 'Wentworth', 'Tick', 'Tick']"
'Hah! It was. Jenny would've eaten you up if you'd used a stick. A frying pan is made of iron. Creatures of that kidney can't stand iron.',13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,68,['Jenny']
"It had started with The Goode Childe's Booke of Faerie Tales. Actually, it had probably started with a lot of things, but the stories most of all.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,71,"[""Goode Childe's""]"
"Her mother had read them to her when she was little, and then she'd read them to herself. And all the stories had, somewhere, the witch. The wicked old witch.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,72,[]
"The stories never said why she was wicked. It was enough to be an old woman, enough to be all alone, enough to look strange because you had no teeth. It was enough to be called a witch.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,74,[]
"If it came to that, the book never gave you the evidence of anything. It talked about 'a handsome prince'... was he really, or was it just because he was a prince that people called him handsome? As for 'a girl who was as beautiful as the day was long'... well, which day? In midwinter it hardly ever got light! The stories didn't want you to think, they just wanted you to believe what you were told...",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,75,[]
"And you were told that the old witch lived all by herself in a strange cottage made of gingerbread or which ran around on giant hen's feet, and talked to animals, and could do magic.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,76,[]
"Well, no. That wasn't quite true. But she had only ever known one old woman who lived in a strange house that moved about, and that was Granny Aching. And she could do magic, sheep magic, and she talked to animals and there was nothing wicked about her. That proved you couldn't believe the stories.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,78,['Granny Aching']
"And there had been the other old woman, the one who everyone said was a witch. And what had happened to her had made Tiffany very... thoughtful.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,79,['Tiffany']
"Anyway, she preferred the witches to the smug handsome princes and especially to the stupid smirking princesses, who didn't have the sense of a beetle. They had lovely golden hair, too, and Tiffany didn't. Her hair was brown, plain brown. Her mother called it chestnut, or sometimes auburn, but Tiffany knew it was brown, brown, brown, just like her eyes. Brown as earth. And did the book have any adventures for people who had brown eyes and brown hair? No, no, no... it was the blond people with blue eyes and the redheads with green eyes who got the stories. If you had brown hair you were probably just a servant or a woodcutter or something. Or a dairymaid. Well, that was not going to happen, even if she was good at cheese. She couldn't be the prince, and she'd never be a princess, and she didn't want to be a woodcutter, so she'd be the witch and know things, just like Granny Aching",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,80,['Granny Aching']
"Who was Granny Aching? People would start asking that now. And the answer was: what Granny Aching was, was there. She was always there. It seemed that the lives of all the Achings revolved around Granny Aching. Down in the village decisions were made, things were done, life went on in the knowledge that in her old wheeled shepherding hut on the hills Granny Aching was there, watching.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,82,"['Granny Aching', 'Granny Aching', 'Achings', 'Granny Aching', 'Granny Aching']"
"And she was the silence of the hills. Perhaps that's why she liked Tiffany, in her awkward, hesitant way. Her older sisters chattered, and Granny didn't like noise. Tiffany didn't make noise when she was up at the hut. She just loved being there. She'd watch the buzzards, and listen to the noise of the silence.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,83,['Granny']
"It did have a noise, up there. Sounds, voices, animal noises floating up onto the downs, somehow made the silence deep and complex. And Granny Aching wrapped this silence around herself and made room inside it for Tiffany. It was always too busy on the farm. There were a lot of people with a lot to do. There wasn't enough time for silence. There wasn't time for listening. But Granny Aching was silent and listened all the time.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,84,"['Granny Aching', 'Granny Aching']"
"Miss Tick coughed. 'Well, cussing, now, cussing isn't like genuine cursing. Cussing's more like dang and botheration and darned and drat, you know? Cursing is more on the lines of ""I hope your nose explodes and your ears go flying away.""'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,92,['Tick']
"'I think Granny's cussing was a bit more than that,' said Tiffany, in a very definite voice. 'And she talked to her dogs.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,93,['Granny']
"'Oh, things like come by and away to me and that'll do,' said Tiffany. They always did what she told them.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,95,[]
"'Well, that still makes them familiars, doesn't it?' Tiffany retorted, feeling annoyed. 'Witches have animals they can talk to, called familiars. Like your toad there.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,97,[]
"'And she knew about all kinds of herbs,' Tiffany persisted. Granny Aching was going to be a witch even if Tiffany had to argue all day. 'She could cure anything. My father said she could make a shepherd's pie stand up and baa.' Tiffany lowered her voice. 'She could bring lambs back to life...'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,99,['Granny Aching']
"You hardly ever saw Granny Aching indoors in the spring and summer. She spent most of the year sleeping in the old wheeled hut, which could be dragged across the downs after the flocks. But the first time Tiffany could remember seeing the old woman in the farmhouse, she was kneeling in front of the fire, putting a dead lamb in the big black oven.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,100,['Granny Aching']
"Tiffany had screamed and screamed. And Granny had gently picked her up, a little awkwardly, and sat her on her lap and shushed her and called her 'my little jiggit', while on the floor her sheepdogs, Thunder and Lightning, watched her in doggish amazement. Granny wasn't particularly at home around children, because they didn't baa.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,101,"['Granny', 'Granny']"
"When Tiffany had stopped crying out of sheer lack of breath, Granny had put her down on the rug and opened the oven, and Tiffany had watched the lamb come alive again.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,102,"['Tiffany', 'Granny']"
"When Tiffany got a little older, she found out that 'jiggit' meant twenty in the Van Tan Tethera, the ancient counting language of the shepherds. The older people still used it when they were counting things they thought of as special. She was Granny Aching's twentieth grandchild.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,103,"['Van Tan Tethera', ""Granny Aching's""]"
"And when she was older she also understood all about the warming oven, which never got more than, well, warm. Her mother would let the bread dough rise in it, and Ratbag the cat would sleep in it, sometimes on the dough. It was just the place to revive a weak lamb that had been born on a snowy night and was near death from the cold. That was how it worked. No magic at all. But that time it had been magic. And it didn't stop being magic just because you found out how it was done.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,104,['Ratbag']
"'Good, but still not exactly witchcraft,' said Miss Tick, breaking the spell again. 'Anyway, you don't have to have a witch ancestor to be a witch. It helps, of course, because of heredity.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,105,['Tick']
"'Partly, I suppose,' said Miss Tick. 'But I was thinking of pointy hats, for example. If you have a grandmother who can pass on her pointy hat to you, that saves a great deal of expense. They are incredibly hard to come by, especially ones strong enough to withstand falling farmhouses. Did Mrs Aching have anything like that?'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,107,"['Tick', 'Mrs Aching']"
"'I don't think so,' said Tiffany. 'She hardly ever wore a hat except in the very cold weather. She wore an old grain sack as a sort of hood. Um... does that count?'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,108,['Tiffany']
"For the first time, Miss Tick looked a little less flinty. 'Possibly, possibly,' she said. 'Do you have any brothers and sisters, Tiffany?'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,109,"['Tick', 'Tiffany']"
"'And then you weren't the baby any more because you had a dear little brother,' said Miss Tick. The only boy, too. That must have been a nice surprise.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,111,[]
"The smile faded. Miss Tick thought: This child is sharp. 'Just a guess,' she said. No one likes admitting to spying.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,114,['Tick']
"'Whatever,' said Tiffany. 'You think I don't like him because my parents make a fuss of him and spoil him, yes?'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,117,['Tiffany']
"'Well, it did cross my mind,' said Miss Tick, and gave up worrying about the spying. She was a witch, and that was all there was to it. 'I think it was the bit when you used him as bait for a slathering monster that gave me a hint,' she added.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,118,['Tick']
"'He's just a nuisance!' said Tiffany. 'He takes up my time and I'm always having to look after him and he always wants sweets. Anyway,' she continued, 'I had to think fast.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,119,['Tiffany']
"'Granny Aching would have done something about monsters in our river,' said Tiffany, ignoring that. 'Even if they are out of books.' And she'd have done something about what happened to old Mrs Snapperly, she added to herself. She'd have spoken up, and people would have listened... They always listened when Granny spoke up. Speak up for those who don't have voices, she always said.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,121,"['Granny Aching', 'Mrs Snapperly', 'Granny']"
"'Good,' said Miss Tick. 'So she should. Witches deal with things. You said the river was very shallow where Jenny leaped up? And the world looked blurred and shaky? Was there a susurrus?'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,122,"['Tick', 'Jenny']"
"'And now I'm slightly impressed,' said Miss Tick. 'You said, ""Can I stop it?"", not ""Can anyone stop it?"" or ""Can we stop it?"" That's good. You accept responsibility. That's a good start. And you keep a cool head. But, no, you can't stop it.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,127,['Tick']
"'Lucky hit,' said Miss Tick. There may be worse than her on the way, believe me. I believe an incursion of major proportions is going to start here and, clever though you are, my girl, you have as much chance as one of your lambs on a snowy night. You keep clear. I'll try to fetch help.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,129,['Tick']

"'Everyone said she was a witch,' said Tiffany. She really did not want to talk about this. No one in the villages around here wanted to talk about it. No one went near the ruins of the cottage in the woods, either.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,147,[]
"'Um...' Tiffany squirmed. 'You see... the Baron had a son called Roland. He was only twelve, I think. And he went riding in the woods by himself last summer and his dogs came back without him.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,149,"['Baron', 'Roland']"
"'And people think she killed him?' said Miss Tick. She sighed. They probably think she cooked him in the oven, or something.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,152,['Tick']
"'No,' said Tiffany. 'And that was strange, because if it'd turned up anywhere along the hills the people would have noticed it...'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,155,['Tiffany']
"'Yes. And she had a cat. And a squint,' said Tiffany. And it all came out in a rush: 'And so after he vanished they went to her cottage and they looked in the oven and they dug up her garden and they threw stones at her old cat until it died and they turned her out of her cottage and piled up all her old books in the middle of the room and set fire to them and burned the place to the ground and everyone said she was an old witch.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,160,[]
"Tiffany sighed. 'Yes, I went to the cottage next day and some of the pages, you know, had kind of floated up in the heat. And I found a part of one, and it had all old lettering and gold and blue edging. And I buried her cat.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,166,[]
"'And you measured the oven,' said Miss Tick. 'I know you did, because you just told me what size it was.' And you measure soup plates, Miss Tick added to herself. What have I found here?",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,169,"['Tick', 'Tick']"
"'Well, yes. I did. I mean... it was tiny! And if she could magic away a boy and a whole horse, why didn't she magic away the men who came for her? It didn't make any sense!'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,170,[]
"'Then the Baron said no one was to have anything to do with her,' said Tiffany. 'He said any witches found in the country would be tied up and thrown in the pond. Er, you could be in danger,' she added, uncertainly.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,172,['Tiffany']
"'I can untie knots with my teeth and I have a Gold Swimming Certificate from the Quirm College for Young Ladies,' said Miss Tick. 'All that practice at jumping into the swimming pool with my clothes on was time well spent.' She leaned forward. 'Let me guess what happened to Mrs Snapperly,' she said. 'She lived from the summer until the snow, right? She stole food from barns and probably women gave her food at the back door if the men weren't around? I expect the bigger boys threw things at her if they saw her.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,173,"['Tick', 'Mrs Snapperly']"
"'I think she was just a sick old lady who was no use to anyone and smelled a bit and looked odd because she had no teeth,' said Tiffany. 'She just looked like a witch in a story. Anyone with half a mind could see that.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,176,['Tiffany']
"'Good answer. You might make a decent witch one day,' she said. 'But I don't teach people to be witches. I teach people about witches. Witches learn in a special school. I just show them the way, if they're any good. All witches have special interests, and I like children.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,182,[]
"'Well, witches don't have to be nice,' said Miss Tick, pulling a large black bag from under the table. 'I'm glad to see you pay attention.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,187,['Tick']
"'Why should it? A unicorn is nothing more than a big horse that comes to a point, anyway. Nothing to get so excited about,' said Miss Tick. 'And that will be one egg, please.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,197,['Tick']
"'Thank you. Ready? To find the school for witches, go to a high place near here, climb to the top, open your eyes...' Miss Tick hesitated.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,201,['Tick']
Silence suddenly filled the tent. The sound of bad spelling and erratic geography filtered through from outside as Tiffany and Miss Tick stared into one another's eyes.,13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,210,['Tick']
"'I see,' said Miss Tick, looking away. 'Very well. In that case, please tell me... when you stopped outside my tent just now you said ""Aha"" in what I considered to be a smug tone of voice. Were you thinking, This is a strange little black tent with a mysterious little sign on the door, so going inside could be the start of an adventure, or were you thinking, This could be the tent of some wicked witch like they thought Mrs Snapperly was, who'll put some horrible spell on me as soon as I go in? It's all right, you can stop staring now. Your eyes are watering.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,215,"['Tick', 'Mrs Snapperly']"
"'Good answer. Witches are naturally nosy,' said Miss Tick, standing up. 'Well, I must go. I hope we shall meet again. I will give you some free advice, though.'",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,219,['Tick']
'... you'll still get beaten by people who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren't so lazy. Goodbye.',13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,231,[]
The tent seemed to grow darker. It was time to leave. Tiffany found herself back in the square where the other teachers were taking down their stalls.,13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,232,[]
"She didn't look round. She knew enough not to look around. Either the tent would still be there, which would be a disappointment, or it would have mysteriously disappeared, and that would be worrying.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,233,[]
"She headed home, and wondered if she should have mentioned the little red-haired men. She hadn't for a whole lot of reasons. She wasn't sure, now, that she'd really seen them; she had a feeling that they wouldn't have wanted her to; and it was nice to have something Miss Tick didn't know. Yes. That was the best part. Miss Tick was a bit too clever, in Tiffany's opinion.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,234,['Tick']
"On the way home she climbed to the top of Arken Hill, which was just outside the village. It wasn't very big, not even as high as the downs above the farm and certainly nothing like as high as the mountains.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,235,['Arken Hill']
"The hill was more... homely. There was a flat place at the top where nothing ever grew, and Tiffany knew there was a story that a hero had once fought a dragon up there and its blood had burned the ground where it fell. There was another story that said there was a heap of treasure under the hill, defended by the dragon, and another story that said a king was buried there in armour of solid gold. There were lots of stories about the hill; it was surprising it hadn't sunk under the weight of them.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,236,[]
"She could see the village and the river and Home Farm, and the Baron's castle and, beyond the fields she knew, she could see grey woods and heathlands.",13_The Wee Free Men,1,Chapter 2Miss Tick,238,['Baron']
"Miss Tick removed her hat, reached inside and pulled a piece of string. With little clicks and flapping noises the hat took up the shape of a rather elderly straw hat. She picked up the paper flowers from the ground and stuck them on, carefully.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,0,['Tick']
"'Right. Just like you. She's impressed you, right? I know she did because you were quite nasty to her, and you always do that to people who impress you.'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,6,[]
"'Well, now, let me see...' said the toad sarcastically. 'Better skin, better legs, likelihood of being kissed by a princess one hundred per cent improved... why, yes. Whenever you're ready, madam.'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,8,[]
"'So did I,' said Miss Tick, briskly. 'She hears about an old lady dying because these idiots thought she was a witch, and she decides to become a witch so that they don't try that again. A monster roars up out of her river and she bashes it with a frying pan! Have you ever heard the saying ""The land finds its witch""? It's happened here, I'll bet. But a chalk witch? Witches like granite and basalt, hard rock all the way down! Do you know what chalk is?'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,11,['Tick']
"'It's the shells of billions and billions of tiny, helpless little sea creatures that died millions of years ago,' said Miss Tick. 'It's... tiny, tiny bones. Soft. Soggy. Damp. Even limestone is better than that. But... she's grown up on chalk and she is hard, and sharp, too. She's a born witch. On chalk! Which is impossible!'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,13,['Tick']
"'Maybe, but she needs more than that. Jenny isn't clever,' said Miss Tick. 'She's only a Grade One Prohibitory Monster. And she was probably bewildered to find herself in a stream, when her natural home is in stagnant water. There'll be much, much worse than her.'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,15,"['Jenny', 'Tick']"
"'I am a teacher as well as a witch,' said Miss Tick, adjusting her hat carefully. 'Therefore I make lists. I make assessments. I write things down in a neat, firm hand with pens of two colours. Jenny is one of a number of creatures invented by adults to scare children away from dangerous places.' She sighed. 'If only people would think before they make up monsters.'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,17,"['Tick', 'Jenny']"
"'I've got practically no power here,' said Miss Tick. 'I told you. It's the chalk. And remember the redheaded men. A Nac Mac Feegle spoke to her! Warned her! I've never seen one in my life! If she's got them on her side, who knows what she can do?'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,19,['Tick']
"She picked up the toad. 'D'you know what'll be turning up?' she continued. 'All the things they locked away in those old stories. All those reasons why you shouldn't stray off the path, or open the forbidden door, or say the wrong word, or spill the salt. All the stories that gave children nightmares. All the monsters from under the biggest bed in the world. Somewhere, all stories are real and all dreams come true. And they'll come true here if they're not stopped. If it wasn't for the Nac Mac Feegle I'd be really worried. As it is, I'm going to try and get some help. That's going to take me at least two days without a broomstick!'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,20,[]
"Tiffany shared a bedroom with Fastidia and Hannah. She woke up when she heard them come to bed, and lay in the dark until she heard their breathing settle down and they started to dream of young sheep shearers with their shirts off.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,24,"['Fastidia', 'Hannah']"
"Thunder and Lightning. She knew them as dogs before she knew them as the sound and light of a storm. Granny always had her sheepdogs with her, indoors and out. One moment they would be black and white streaks across the distant turf and then they were suddenly there, panting, eyes never leaving Granny's face. Half the dogs on the hills were Lightning's puppies, trained by Granny Aching.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,26,"['Granny', 'Granny', 'Granny Aching']"
"Tiffany had gone with the family to the big Sheepdog Trials. Every shepherd on the Chalk went to them, and the very best entered the arena to show how well they could work their dogs. The dogs would round up sheep, separate them, drive them into the pensor sometimes run off, or snap at one another, because even the best dog can have a bad day. But Granny never entered with Thunder and Lightning. She'd lean on the fence with the dogs lying in front of her, watching the show intently and puffing her foul pipe. And Tiffany's father had said that, after each shepherd had worked his dogs, the judges would look nervously across at Granny Aching to see what she thought.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,27,"['Granny', 'Granny Aching']"
"In fact all the shepherds watched her. Granny never, ever entered the arena because she was the Trials. If Granny thought you were a good shepherdif she nodded at you when you walked out of the arena, if she puffed at her pipe and said 'that'll do'you walked like a giant for a day, you owned the Chalk...",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,28,"['Granny', 'Granny']"
"When she was small and up on the wold with Granny, Thunder and Lightning would baby-sit Tiffany, lying attentively a few feet away as she played. And she'd been so proud when Granny had let her use them to round up a flock. She'd run about excitedly in all directions shouting 'Come by!' and 'There!' and 'Walk up!' and, glory be, the dogs had worked perfectly.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,29,"['Granny', 'Granny']"
"She knew now that they'd have worked perfectly whatever she'd shouted. Granny was just sitting there, smoking her pipe, and by now the dogs could read her mind. They only ever took orders from Granny Aching...",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,30,"['Granny', 'Granny Aching']"
"At some point Ratbag the cat pushed open the door and jumped onto the bed. He was big to start with, but Ratbag flowed. He was so fat that, on any reasonably flat surface, he gradually spread out in a great puddle of fur. He hated Tiffany, but would never let personal feelings get in the way of a warm place to sleep.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,32,"['Ratbag', 'Ratbag']"
"'Crivens! It's a' vena well sayin' ""find the hag"", but what should we be lookin' for, can ye tell me that? All these big jobs look just the same tae me!'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,35,['Crivens']
"There was silence, embroidered with the breathing of her sisters. But in a way Tiffany couldn't quite describe, it was the silence of people trying hard not to make any noise.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,41,[]
"She knew every inch of the country for two miles around. She liked the river best, with the backwaters where striped pike sunbathed just above the weeds and the banks where kingfishers nested. There was a heronry a mile or so upriver and she liked to creep up on the birds when they came down here to fish in the reeds, because there's nothing funnier than a heron trying to get airborne in a hurry...",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,46,[]
"She drifted off to sleep again, thinking about the land around the farm. She knew all of it. There were no secret places that she didn't know about.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,47,[]
"But maybe there were magical doors. That's what she'd make, if she had a magical school. There should be secret doorways everywhere, even hundreds of miles away. Look at a special rock by, say, moonlight, and there would be yet another door.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,48,[]
"But the school, now, the school. There would be lessons in broomstick riding and how to sharpen your hat to a point, and magical meals, and lots of new friends.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,49,[]
Tiffany opened her eyes in the darkness. The voices under the bed had a slightly echoey edge. Thank goodness the guzunder was nice and clean.,13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,52,[]
"It was quite a large one, made by Mr Block the farm carpenter when Tiffany's oldest sister, who already had two babies of her own now, was a little girl. It wasn't the most fragile of items. Mr Block did not go in for delicate work. But over the years the girls had decorated it with bits of material and some rough and ready furniture.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,57,"['Mr Block', 'Block']"
"Strictly speaking, they had no place in the doll's house, but Wentworth wasn't old enough for them and so they'd got used as innocent bystanders back in those days when Tiffany had made tea parties for her dolls. Well, what passed for dolls. Such toys as there were in the farmhouse had to be tough to survive intact through the generations and didn't always manage it. Last time Tiffany had tried to arrange a party, the guests had been a rag doll with no head, two wooden soldiers and three-quarters of a small teddy bear.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,65,['Wentworth']
"'I got one! Hey, pal, can yer mammie sew? Stitch this! Aargh! He's got a held on him like a tree!'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,67,['Aargh']
"It seemed to Tiffany that although the owners of the three voices were fighting things that couldn't possibly fight back, including a teddy bear with only one leg, the fight still wasn't going all one way.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,70,[]
"Tiffany felt Ratbag stir. He might be fat and lazy, but he was lightning fast when it came to leaping on small creatures. She couldn't let him get the... whatever they were, however bad they sounded.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,74,['Ratbag']
"Silence fell again and this time, Tiffany decided after a while, it was the silence of no one there rather than the silence of people being incredibly quiet. Ratbag went back to sleep, twitching occasionally as he disembowelled something in his fat cat dreams.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,77,['Ratbag']
"Tiffany waited a little while and then got out of bed and crept towards the bedroom door, avoiding the two squeaky floorboards. She went downstairs in the dark, found a chair by moonlight, fished the book of Faerie Tales off Granny's shelf, then lifted the latch on the back door and stepped out into the warm midsummer night.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,78,['Granny']
"There was a lot of mist around, but a few stars were visible overhead and there was a gibbous moon in the sky. Tiffany knew it was gibbous because she'd read in the Almanack that 'gibbous' meant what the moon looked like when it was just a bit fatter than half full, and so she made a point of paying attention to it around those times just so that she could say to herself: 'Ah, I see the moon's very gibbous tonight...'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,79,[]
Against the rising moon the downs were a black wall that filled half the sky. For a moment she looked for the light of Granny Aching's lantern...,13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,81,"[""Granny Aching's""]"
"Granny never lost a lamb. That was one of Tiffany's first memories: of being held by her mother at the window one frosty night in early spring, with a million brilliant stars glinting over the mountains and, on the darkness of the downs, the one yellow star in the constellation of Granny Aching, zigzagging through the night. She wouldn't go to bed while a lamb was lost, however bad the weather...",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,82,"['Granny', 'Granny Aching']"
"There was only one place where it was possible for someone in a large family to be private, and that was in the privy. It was a three-holer, and it was where everyone went if they wanted to be alone for a while. There was a candle in there, and last year's Almanack hanging on a string. The printers knew their readership, and printed the Almanack on soft thin paper.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,83,[]
"Tiffany lit the candle, made herself comfortable, and looked at the book of Faerie Tales. The moon gibbous'd at her through the crescent-shaped hole cut in the door.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,84,[]
"She'd never really liked the book. It seemed to her that it tried to tell her what to do and what to think. Don't stray from the path, don't open that door, but hate the wicked witch because she is wicked. Oh, and believe that shoe size is a good way of choosing a wife.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,85,[]
"A lot of the stories were highly suspicious, in her opinion. There was the one that ended when the two good children pushed the wicked witch into her own oven. Tiffany had worried about that after all that trouble with Mrs Snapperly. Stories like this stopped people thinking properly, she was sure. She'd read that one and thought, Excuse me? No one has an oven big enough to get a whole person in, and what made the children think they could just walk around eating people's houses in any case? And why does some boy too stupid to know a cow is worth a lot more than five beans have the right to murder a giant and steal all his gold? Not to mention commit an act of ecological vandalism? And some girl who can't tell the difference between a wolf and her grandmother must either have been as dense as teak or come from an extremely ugly family. The stories weren't real. But Mrs Snapperly had died because of stories.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,86,"['Mrs Snapperly', 'Mrs Snapperly']"
"She flicked past page after page, looking for the right pictures. Because, although the stories made her angry, the pictures, ah, the pictures were the most beautiful things she'd ever seen.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,87,[]
"Most of the pictures of fairies were not very impressive. Frankly, they looked like a small girls' ballet class that'd just had to run through a bramble patch. But this one... was different. The colours were strange, and there were no shadows. Giant grasses and daisies grew everywhere, so the fairies must have been quite small, but they looked big. They looked like rather strange humans. They certainly didn't look much like fairies. Hardly any of them had wings. They were odd shapes, in fact. In fact, some of them looked like monsters. The girls in the tutus wouldn't have stood much chance.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,89,[]
"And the odd thing was that, alone of all the pictures in the book, this one looked as if it had been done by an artist who had painted what was in front of him. The other pictures, the ballet girls and the romper-suit babies, had a made-up, syrupy look. This one didn't. This one said that the artist had been there...",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,90,[]
"She concentrated on the bottom left-hand corner, and there it was. She'd seen it before, but you had to know where to look. It was definitely a little red-haired man, naked except for a kilt and a skinny waistcoat, scowling out of the picture. He looked very angry. And... Tiffany moved the candle to see more clearly... he was definitely making a gesture with his hand.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,92,[]
"She heard voices. She pushed the door open with her foot to hear them better, because a witch always listens to other people's conversations.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,94,[]
"The sound was coming from the other side of the hedge, where there was a field that should have been full of nothing but sheep, waiting to go to market. Sheep are not known for their conversation. She snuck out carefully in the misty dawn and found a small gap that had been made by rabbits, which just gave her a good enough view.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,95,[]
"There was a ram grazing near the hedge and the conversation was coming from it or, rather, somewhere in the long grass underneath it. There seemed to be at least four speakers, who sounded bad-tempered.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,96,[]
"The sheep rose a little in the air, and bleated in alarm as it started to go across the field backwards. Tiffany thought she saw a hint of red hair in the grass around its legs, but that vanished as the ram was carried away into the mist.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,102,[]
"She pushed her way through the hedge, ignoring the twigs that scratched at her. Granny Aching wouldn't have let anyone get away with stealing a sheep, even if they were invisible.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,103,['Granny Aching']
The disappearing-backwards sheep could wait. Now the hens needed her. A fox had got in twice in the last two weeks and the hens that hadn't been taken were barely laying.,13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,105,[]
"There were no flying feathers, and nothing like the panic a fox would cause. But the chickens were clucking excitedly and Prunes, the cockerel, was strutting nervously up and down. One of the hens looked a bit embarrassed. Tiffany lifted it up quickly. There were two tiny blue, red-haired men underneath. They were each holding an egg, clasped in their arms. They looked up with very guilty expressions.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,107,[]
"'Whut? Oh, these? These are eiggs, are they?' said the one who'd spoken first, looking at the eggs as if he'd never seen them before. 'There's a thing. And there was us thinking they was, er, stones.'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,113,[]
"'We crawled under yon chookie for a wee bitty warmth,' said the first one. 'And there was all these things, we thought they was stones, which was why the puir fowl was clucking all the time...'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,115,[]
"The one who hadn't been doing much talking nudged the other one. 'Best do as she says,' it said. 'It's a' gang agley. Ye canna cross an Aching an' this one's a hag. She dinged Jenny an' no one ha' ever done that afore.'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,119,"['Ye canna', 'Jenny']"
Both of the tiny men put the eggs back very carefully. One of them even breathed on the shell of his and made a show of polishing it with the ragged hem of his kilt.,13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,121,[]
"'No harm done, mistress,' he said. He looked at the other man. And then they vanished. But there was a suspicion of a red blur in the air and some straw by the henhouse door flew up in the air.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,122,[]
"'And I'm a miss!' shouted Tiffany. She lowered the hen back onto the eggs, and went to the door. 'And I'mnot a hag! Are you fairies of some sort? And what about our shipI mean, sheep?' she added.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,123,['Tiffany']
"She rescued the Faerie Tales, blew out the candle and made her way into the house. Her mother was lighting the fire and asked what she was doing up, and she said that she'd heard a commotion in the henhouse and had gone out to see if it was the fox again. That wasn't a lie. In fact, it was completely true, even if it wasn't exactly accurate.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,125,[]
"Tiffany was on the whole quite a truthful person, but it seemed to her that there were times when things didn't divide easily into 'true' and 'false', but instead could be 'things that people needed to know at the moment' and 'things that they didn't need to know at the moment'.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,126,[]
"There was porridge for breakfast. She ate it hurriedly, meaning to get back out into the paddock and see about that sheep. There might be tracks in the grass, or something...",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,128,[]
"Ratbag had been asleep in front of the oven. Now he was sitting up, alert. Tiffany felt a prickling on the back of her neck, and tried to see what the cat was looking at.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,130,['Ratbag']
"On the dresser was a row of blue and white jars which weren't very useful for anything. They'd been left to her mother by an elderly aunt, and she was proud of them because they looked nice but were completely useless. There was little room on the farm for useless things that looked nice, so they were treasured.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,131,[]
"Ratbag was watching the lid of one of them. It was rising very slowly, and under it was a hint of red hair and two beady, staring eyes.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,132,['Ratbag']
"It lowered again when Tiffany gave it a long stare. A moment later she heard a faint rattle and, when she looked up, the pot was wobbling back and forth and there was a little cloud of dust rising along the top of the dresser. Ratbag was looking around in bewilderment.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,133,"['Tiffany', 'Ratbag']"
"She ran out into the paddock and looked around. The mist was off the grass now, and skylarks were rising on the downs.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,135,[]
"It was something Granny Aching had said once, when Tiffany had been crying about a lamb. She had an old-fashioned way of speaking, and had said: 'We are as gods to the beasts o' the field, my jiggit. We order the time o' their birth and the time o' their death. Between times, we ha' a duty.'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,143,['Granny Aching']
"'We have a duty,' Tiffany repeated, more softly. She glared around the field. 'I know you can hear me, whoever you are. If that sheep doesn't come back, there will be... trouble...'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,144,[]
"Tiffany had to do the chores before she had any more time to herself. That meant feeding the chickens and collecting the eggs, and feeling slightly proud of the fact that there were two more than there might otherwise have been. It meant fetching six buckets of water from the well and filling the log basket by the stove, but she put those jobs off because she didn't like doing them much. She did quite like churning butter, though. It gave her time to think.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,146,[]
"When I'm a witch with a pointy hat and a broomstick, she thought as she pumped the handle, I'll wave my hand and the butter will come just like that. And any little red-headed devils that even think about taking our beasts will be",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,147,[]
"She went back to the churning as if nothing had happened but stopped after a while and went over to the flour bin. She took a small handful of flour and dusted it over the doorstep, and then went back to the churning.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,150,[]
"A few minutes later there was another watery sound behind her. When she turned round there was, yes, another full bucket. And in the flour on the stone doorstep were just two lines of little footprints, one leading out of the dairy and one coming back.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,151,[]
"She looked up at the big wooden beams that ran across the room, and a little dust fell down, as if something had quickly moved out of the way.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,154,[]
"I think I ought to put a stop to this right now, she thought. On the other hand, there's no harm in waiting until all the buckets are filled up.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,155,[]
"'And then I'll have to fill the log box in the scullery,' she said aloud. Well, it was worth a try.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,156,[]
"She went back to the churning, and didn't bother to turn her head when she heard four more sloshes behind her. Nor did she look round when she heard little whooshwhoosh noises and the clatter of logs in the box. She only turned to see when the noise stopped.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,157,[]
"The log box was full up to the ceiling, and all the buckets were full. The patch of flour was a mass of footprints.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,158,[]
"'Er... thank you,' she said. No, that wasn't right. She sounded nervous. She let go of the butter paddle and stood up, trying to look as fierce as possible.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,160,[]
There was a bleating from the paddock. She ran out to the bottom of the garden and looked through the hedge.,13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,162,[]
"The sheep was coming back, backwards and at high speed. It jerked to a halt a little way from the hedge and dropped down as the little men let it go. One of the red-headed men appeared for a moment on its head. He huffed on a horn, polished it with his kilt, and vanished in a blur.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,163,[]
"Oh, and when she got back the butter had been churned. Not just churned, in fact, but patted into a dozen fat golden oblongs on the marble she used when she did it. There was even a sprig of parsley on each one.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,165,[]
"Are they brownies? she wondered. According to the Faerie Tales, brownies hung around the house doing chores in exchange for a saucer of milk. But in the picture they'd been cheery little creatures with long pointy hoods. The red-haired men didn't look as if they'd ever drunk milk in their lives, but perhaps it was worth a try.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,166,[]
"'Well,' she said aloud, still aware of the hidden watchers. 'That'll do. Thank you. I'm glad you're sorry for what you did.'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,167,[]
"She took one of the cat's saucers from the pile by the sink, washed it carefully, filled it with milk from today's churn, then put it down on the floor and stood back. 'Are you brownies?' she said.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,168,[]
"She lay down and looked under the sink, and then peered behind the cheese shelves. She stared up into the dark, spidery shadows of the room. It felt empty.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,172,[]
"Tiffany had walked along the steep track from the farm down into the village hundreds of times. It was less than half a mile long, and over the centuries the carts had worn it down so that it was more like a gully in the chalk and ran like a milky stream in wet weather.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,174,[]
"She was halfway down when the susurrus started. The hedges rustled without a wind. The skylarks stopped singing and, while she hadn't really noticed their song, their silence was a shock. Nothing's louder than the end of a song that's always been there.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,175,[]
"When she looked up at the sky it was like looking through a diamond. It sparkled, and the air went cold so quickly that it was like stepping into an icy bath.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,176,[]
"They were in the field beside her. A horse was galloping through the snow, behind the hedge that was now, suddenly, just a wall of white.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,178,[]
"The hoofbeats stopped. There was a moment of silence and then a horse landed in the lane, skidding on the snow. It pulled itself upright, and the rider turned it to face Tiffany.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,179,[]
"She had two legs, slipping on ice. A horse had twice as many legs to slip. She'd seen horses try to tackle this hill in icy weather. She had a chance.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,182,[]
"She heard a breathy, whistling noise behind her, and a whinny from the horse. She risked a glance. The horse was coming after her, but slowly, half walking and half sliding. Steam poured off it.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,183,[]
"About halfway down the slope the lane passed under an arch of trees, looking like crashed clouds now under their weight of snow. And beyond them, Tiffany knew, the lane flattened out. The headless man would catch her on the flat. She didn't know what would happen after that, but she was sure it would be unpleasantly short.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,184,[]
"Flakes of snow dropped on her as she passed under the trees, and she decided to make a run for it. She might reach the village. She was good at running.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,185,[]
"But if she got there, then what? She'd never reach a door in time. And people would shout, and run about. The dark horseman didn't look like someone who'd take much notice of that. No, she had to deal with it.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,186,[]
"Tiffany turned round. The horseman was trotting under the trees now, the horse more certain as the ground levelled. He had a sword in his hand, and he was looking at her, with the eyes he didn't have. There was the breathy noise again, not good to hear.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,196,[]
"The little men are watching me, she thought. I can't run. Granny Aching wouldn't have run from a thing with no head.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,197,['Granny Aching']
"A blue and red shape, larger than the other little men, dropped out of the trees. He landed on the horse's forehead, between its eyes, and grabbed an ear in both hands.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,200,[]
"Tiffany heard the man shout: 'Here's a face full o' dandruff for ye, yer bogle, courtesy of Big Yan!' and then the man hit the horse between the eyes with his head.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,201,[]
"This time the horse danced uneasily the other way, and then its back legs slid from under it and it collapsed in the snow.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,204,[]
"Little blue men erupted from the hedge. The horseman, trying to get to his feet, disappeared under a blue and red storm of screaming creatures",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,205,[]
"The blue men, for a moment, were in a pile on the hot, dusty road. One of them said, 'Aw, crivens! I kicked meself in me own heid!' And then they, too, vanished, but for a moment Tiffany saw blue and red blurs disappearing into the hedge.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,207,['Tiffany']
"Then the skylarks were back. The hedges were green and full of flowers. Not a twig was broken, not a flower disturbed. The sky was blue, with no flashes of diamond.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,208,[]
"Tiffany looked down. On the toes of her boots, snow was melting. She was, strangely, glad about that. It meant that what had just happened was magical, not madness. Because, if she closed her eyes, she could still hear the wheezy breathing of the headless man.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,209,[]
"The tents had gone. Except for a few pieces of broken chalk, apple cores, some stamped-down grass and, alas, a few chicken feathers, there was nothing at all to show that the teachers had ever been there.",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,212,[]
"'Everything,' said Tiffany. 'We're swamped with tiny men! I can't understand half of what they say! They keep calling me a hag!'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,216,['Tiffany']
"'It snowed, and then it hadn't! I was chased by a horseman with no head.! And one of the... what did you say they were?'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,218,[]
"'Because there's a woman at the well over there giving you a funny look. Put me in your apron pocket, for goodness' sake.'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,231,[]
"'The Feegles tried to steal some of our eggs and one of our sheep,' she said. 'But I got them back.'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,237,[]
"The toad looked a bit shifty. 'Miss Tick doesn't really want you to handle this,' it said. 'She'll be back soon with help...'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,244,['Tick']
"'Another world is colliding with this one,' said the toad. There. Happy now? That's what Miss Tick thinks. But it's happening faster than she expected. All the monsters are coming back.'",13_The Wee Free Men,2,Chapter 3Hunt The Hag,250,['Tick']
"Nothing happened on the way back to the farm. The sky stayed blue, none of the sheep in the home paddocks appeared to be travelling backwards very fast, and an air of hot emptiness lay over everything. Ratbag was on the path leading up to the back door, and he had something trapped in his paws. As soon as he saw Tiffany he picked it up and exited around the corner of the house at high speed, legs spinning in the high-speed slink of a guilty cat. Tiffany was too good a shot with a clod of earth.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,0,"['Ratbag', 'Tiffany']"
"'Look at him,' she said. 'Great cowardly blob! I really wish I could stop him catching baby birds, it's so sad!'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,2,[]
"'You haven't got a hat you can wear, have you?' said the toad, from her apron pocket. 'I hate not being able to see.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,3,[]
"'I've got used to slugs and worms and stuff,' said the toad. 'It wasn't easy. Don't worry if you don't have any. I expect you weren't expecting a toad to drop in.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,11,[]
"'Her? Huh, she couldn't do that,' said the toad. 'It's serious magic, turning someone into a toad but leaving them thinking they're human. No, it was a fairy godmother. Never cross a woman with a star on a stick, young lady. They've got a mean streak.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,18,[]
"The toad looked embarrassed. 'I don't know,' it said. 'It's all a bit... foggy. I just know I've been a person. At least, I think I know. It gives me the willies. Sometimes I wake up in the night and I think, was I ever really human? Or was I just a toad that got on her nerves and she made me think I was human once? That'd be a real torture, right? Supposing there's nothing for me to turn back into?' The toad turned worried yellow eyes on her. 'After all, it can't be very hard to mess with a toad's head, yeah? It must be much simpler that turning, oh, a one-hundred-and-sixty-pound human into eight ounces of toad, yes? After all, where's the rest of the mass going to go, I ask myself? Is it just sort of, you know, left over? Very worrying. I mean, I've got one or two memories of being a human, of course, but what's a memory? Just a thought in your brain. You can't be sure it's real. Honestly, on nights when I've eaten a bad slug I wake up screaming, except all that comes out is a croak. Thank you for the milk, it was very nice.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,20,[]
"There was a Feegle on the path. It had made itself some crude wings out of a piece of rag, and a kind of beaky cap out of straw, and was wobbling around in a circle like a wounded bird.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,25,[]
"And down the path Ratbag, arch-enemy of all baby birds, slunk closer, dribbling. As Tiffany opened her mouth to yell, he leaped and landed with all four feet on the little man.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,27,"['Ratbag', 'Tiffany']"
"Or at least where the little man had been, because he had somersaulted in mid-air and was now right in front of Ratbag's face and had grabbed a cat ear with each hand.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,28,['Ratbag']
"He butted the cat hard on the nose. Ratbag spun in the air and landed on his back with his eyes crossed. He squinted in cold terror as the little man leaned down at him and shouted, 'CHEEP!'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,30,['Ratbag']
"Then he levitated in the way that cats do and became a ginger streak, rocketing down the path, through the open door and shooting past Tiffany to hide under the sink.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,31,['Tiffany']
Tiffany's mother was hurrying down the path. Tiffany picked up the toad and put it back in her apron pocket just in time.,13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,34,[]
"'Didn't he go up to the shearing with you, Mum?' said Tiffany, suddenly nervous. She could feel the panic pouring off her mother like smoke.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,36,[]
'We can't find him!' There was a wild look in her mother's eyes. 'I only turned my back for a minute! Are yousure you haven't seen him?',13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,37,[]
"Mrs Aching hurried away. Hastily, Tiffany put the toad on the floor and chivvied him under the sink. She heard him croak and Ratbag, mad with fear and bewilderment, came out from under the sink in a whirl of legs and rocketed out of the door.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,40,"['Mrs Aching', 'Ratbag']"
"She stood up. Her first, shameful thought was: He wanted to go up to watch the shearing. How could he get lost? He went with Mum and Hannah and Fastidia!",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,41,"['Mum', 'Hannah', 'Fastidia']"
"She tried to pretend she hadn't thought that, but she was treacherously good at spotting when she was lying. That's the trouble with a brain: it thinks more than you sometimes want it to.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,43,[]
But he's never interested in moving far away from people! It's half a mile up to the shearing pens! And he doesn't move that fast. After a few feet he flops down and demands sweets!,13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,44,[]
"There it went again, a nasty, shameful thought which she tried to drown out by getting busy. But first she took some sweets out of the jar, as bait, and rustled the bag as she ran from room to room.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,46,[]
"She heard boots in the yard as some of the men came down from the shearing sheds, but got on with looking under beds and in cupboards, even ones so high that a toddler couldn't possibly reach them, and then looked again under beds that she'd already looked under, because it was that kind of search. It was the kind of search where you go and look in the attic, even though the door is always locked.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,47,[]
"After a few minutes there were two or three voices outside, calling for Wentworth, and she heard her father say, ""Try down by the river!'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,48,['Wentworth']
"... and that meant he was frantic too, because Wentworth would never walk that far without a bribe. He was not a child who was happy away from sweets.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,49,['Wentworth']
"It's your fault because you didn't love him very much. He turned up and you weren't the youngest any more, and you had to have him trailing around after you, and you kept wishing, didn't you?, that he'd go away.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,52,[]
"Not very much, admittedly. Not all the time. He didn't know how to play properly, and he never did what he was told. You thought it would be better if he did get lost.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,54,[]
"Anyway, she added in her head, you can't love people all the time when they have a permanently runny nose. And anyway... I wonder...",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,55,[]
"This seemed to have no effect. But the house was full of people, opening and shutting doors and calling out and getting in one another's way, and the... Feegles were shy, despite many of them having faces like a hatful of knuckles.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,57,[]
"She went downstairs. Even some of the women who'd been packing fleeces up at the shearing had come down. They were clustered around her mother, who was sitting at the table, crying. No one noticed Tiffany. That often happened.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,59,[]
"'This is urgent!' snapped Tiffany. 'My little brother has gone missing. In broad daylight! Up on the downs, where you can see for miles!'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,71,[]
"'It's just that's something not many people have ever wanted to do,' said the toad. They're not like brownies. If you get Nac Mac Feegles in the house, it's usually best to move away.' He sighed. Tell me, is your father a drinking man?'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,91,[]
"'Well, I'm not supposed to know about what my father calls the Special Sheep Liniment,' said Tiffany. 'Granny Aching used to make it in the old cowshed.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,94,['Granny Aching']
"'It dissolves spoons,' said Tiffany. 'It's for special occasions. Father says it's not for women because it puts hairs on your chest.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,96,['Tiffany']
"'Then if you want to be sure of finding the Nac Mac Feegles, go and fetch some,' said the toad. 'It will work, believe me.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,97,[]
"Five minutes later Tiffany was ready. Few things are hidden from a quiet child with good eyesight, and she knew where the bottles were stored and she had one now. The cork was hammered in over a piece of rag, but it was old and she was able to lever it out with the tip of a knife. The fumes made her eyes water.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,98,['Tiffany']
There were hundreds. They rose up from behind buckets. They lowered themselves on string from the ceiling beams. They sidled sheepishly from behind the cheese racks. They crept out from under the sink. They came out of places where you'd think a man with hair like an orange gone nova couldn't possibly hide.,13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,104,[]
"They were all about six inches tall and mostly coloured blue, although it was hard to know if that was the actual colour of their skins or just the dye from their tattoos, which covered every inch that wasn't covered with red hair. They wore short kilts, and some wore other bits of clothing too, like skinny waistcoats. A few of them wore rabbit or rat skulls on their heads, as a sort of helmet. And every single one of them carried, slung across his back, a sword nearly as big as he was.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,105,[]
"However, what Tiffany noticed more than anything else was that they were scared of her. Mostly they were looking at their own feet, which was no errand for the faint-hearted because their feet were large, dirty and half tied up with animal skins to make very bad shoes. None of them wanted to look her in the eye.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,106,[]
There was a lot of muttering and nudging and then one of the tiny men removed his rabbit skull helmet and twiddled it nervously in his hands.,13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,115,[]
"'We wuz hungerin', mistress,' he muttered. 'But when we kenned it was thine, we did put the beastie back in the fold.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,116,[]
"Tiffany stared at them. They were all watching her to see what she was going to do next, and the longer she said nothing, the more worried they became. They lowered their swords, looking embarrassed.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,137,[]
"'But we wouldna' dare deny a powerful hag, except mebbe for strong drink,' said the twiddler, his helmet spinning desperately in his hands and his eyes on the bottle of Special Sheep Liniment. 'Will ye no' help us?'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,138,[]
"'Hush yer gob!' shouted the helmet-twiddler, but his voice was lost in the wails and groans of the Nac Mac Feegles. They were pulling at their hair and stamping on the ground and shouting 'Alackaday!' and 'Waily waily waily!' and the toad was arguing with the helmet-twiddler and everyone was getting louder to make themselves heard",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,143,[]
"""Cuz if the Quin is here then it means our kelda is weakenin' fast,' said the helmet-twiddler. 'An' we'll ha' naeone tae look after us.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,149,['Quin']
"To look after us, thought Tiffany. Hundreds of tough little men who could each win the Worst Broken Nose Contest need someone to look after them?",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,150,[]
"'My mother's in the house crying,' she said, 'and...' I don't know how to comfort her, she added to herself. I'm no good at this sort of thing, I never know what I should be saying. Out loud she said: 'And she wants him back. Er. A lot.' She added, hating to say it: 'He's her favourite.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,152,[]
"A gasp went up from the Nac Mac Feegles, and Tiffany heard one of them murmur, 'Aye, she's the hag, sure enough. That's a hag's question!'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,155,[]
"'We dinnae give oor names,' he muttered. But another Feegle, somewhere safe at the back, said, 'Wheest! You cannae refuse a hag!'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,157,[]
"'I'm the Big Man o' the clan, mistress,' he said. 'An' my name it is...' he swallowed, 'Rob Anybody Feegle, mistress. But I beg ye not to use it agin me!'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,159,['Rob Anybody Feegle']
"'They think names have magic in them,' he murmured. 'They don't tell them to people in case they are written down.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,161,[]
"'They think written words are even more powerful,' whispered the toad. 'They think all writing is magic. Words worry them. See their swords? They glow blue in the presence of lawyers.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,167,[]
"'All right,' said Tiffany. 'We're getting somewhere. I promise not to write his name down. Now tell me about this Queen who's taken Wentworth. Queen of what?'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,168,"['Tiffany', 'Queen', 'Wentworth']"
"'Aye, the Quin,' said Rob Anybody. He looked at Tiffany with bright, worried eyes. 'Ye dinnae ken o' the Quin? An' you the wean o' Granny Aching, who had these hills in her bones? Ye dinnae ken the ways? She did not show ye the ways? Ye're no' a hag? How can this be? Ye slammered Jenny Green-Teeth and stared the Heidless Horseman in the eyes he hasnae got, and you dinnae ken?'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,173,"['Quin', 'Rob Anybody', ""Ye dinnae ken o'"", 'Quin', 'Granny Aching', 'Ye dinnae ken', ""Ye're"", 'Ye', 'Jenny Green-Teeth', 'dinnae ken']"
"Tiffany gave him a brittle smile, and then whispered to the toad, 'Who's Ken? And what about his dinner? And what's a wean of Granny Aching?'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,174,"['Ken', 'Granny Aching']"
"'As far as I can make out,' said the toad, 'they're amazed that you don't know about the Queen and... er, the magical ways, what with you being a child of Granny Aching and standing up to the monsters. ""Ken"" means ""know"".'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,175,"['Queen', 'Granny Aching', 'Ken']"
"Hold me up to your ear, will you?' Tiffany did so, and the toad whispered, 'Best not to disappoint them, eh?' She swallowed. 'But she never told me about any magic' she began. And stopped. It was true. Granny Aching hadn't told her about any magic. But she showed people magic every day.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,178,['Granny Aching']
"... There was the time when the Baron's champion hound was caught killing sheep. It was a hunting dog, after all, but it had got out onto the downs and, because sheep run, it had chased...",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,179,['Baron']
"The Baron knew the penalty for sheep-worrying. There were laws on the Chalk, so old that no one remembered who made them, and everyone knew this one: sheep-killing dogs were killed.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,180,['Baron']
"But this dog was worth five hundred gold dollars, and sothe story wentthe Baron sent his servant up onto the downs to Granny's hut on wheels. She was sitting on the step, smoking her pipe and watching the flocks.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,181,"['Baron', 'Granny']"
The man rode up on his horse and didn't bother to dismount. That was not a good thing to do if you wanted Granny Aching to be your friend. Iron-shod hooves cut the turf. She didn't like that.,13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,182,['Granny Aching']
"He said: 'The Baron commands that you find a way to save his dog, Mistress Aching. In return, he will give you a hundred silver dollars.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,183,['Baron']
"Granny had smiled at the horizon, puffed at her pipe for a while, and replied: 'A man who takes arms against his lord, that man is hanged. A starving man who steals his lord's sheep, that man is hanged. A dog that kills sheep, that dog is put to death. Those laws are on these hills and these hills are in my bones. What is a baron, that the law be brake for him?'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,184,['Granny']
"The look Granny Aching gave him turned the man's hair white. That was the story, anyway. But all stones about Granny Aching had a bit of fairy tale about them.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,187,"['Granny Aching', 'Granny Aching']"
"'If it is, as ye say, his law, then let him break it and see how things may then be,' she said.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,188,[]
"A few hours later the Baron sent his bailiff, who was far more important but had known Granny Aching for longer. He said: 'Mrs Aching, the Baron requests that you use your influence to save his dog. He will happily give you fifty gold dollars to help ease this difficult situation. I am sure you can see how this will benefit everyone concerned.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,189,"['Baron', 'Granny Aching', 'Mrs Aching', 'Baron']"

"They said that when the Baron was told this he went very quiet. But although he was pompous, and often unreasonable, and far too haughty, he was not stupid. In the evening he walked up to the hut and sat down on the turf nearby. After a while, Granny Aching said: 'Can I help you, my lord?'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,191,"['Baron', 'Granny Aching']"
"Granny Aching, the story went, stared at the sunset for a while and then said: 'Then be down at the little old stone barn at dawn tomorrow and we'll see if an old dog can learn new tricks. There will be a reckoning. Good night to you.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,199,['Granny Aching']
Most of the village was hanging around the old stone barn the next morning. Granny arrived with one of the smaller farm wagons. It held a ewe with her new-born lamb. She put them in the barn.,13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,200,['Granny']
"Some of the men turned up with the dog. It was nervy and snappy, having spent the night chained up in a shed, and kept trying to bite the men who were holding it by two leather straps. It was hairy. It had fangs.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,201,[]
"'You're putting the dog into the barn with a sheep, Mrs Aching?' said the bailiff. 'Do you want it to choke to death on lamb?'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,203,['Mrs Aching']
"'We shall see,' said Granny. The men dragged the dog to the doorway, threw it inside the barn and slammed the door quickly. People rushed to the little windows.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,205,['Granny']
"There was the bleating of the lamb, a growl from the dog, and then a baa from the lamb's mother. But this wasn't the normal baa of a sheep. It had an edge to it.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,206,[]
"The shaken dog was trying to get to its feet, but it didn't manage it before the ewe charged it again, seventy pounds of enraged sheep slamming into it like a battering ram.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,209,[]
Granny lowered Tiffany again and lit her pipe. She puffed it peacefully as the building behind her shook and the dog yelped and whimpered.,13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,210,['Granny']
"The dog came out limping on three legs, but it hadn't managed to get more than a few feet before the ewe shot out behind it and butted it so hard that it rolled over.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,212,[]
"'He'll mend,' said Granny Aching, carefully ignoring the question. ' 'Tis mostly his pride that's hurt. But he won't look at a sheep again, you have my thumb on that.' And she licked her right thumb and held it out.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,217,['Granny Aching']
"After a moment's hesitation, the Baron licked his thumb, reached down and pressed it against hers. Everyone knew what it meant. On the Chalk, a thumb bargain was unbreakable.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,218,['Baron']
"'For you, at a word, the law was brake,' said Granny Aching. 'Will ye mind that, ye who sit in judgement? Will yer remember this day? Ye'll have cause to.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,219,"['Granny Aching', ""Ye'll""]"
"Next day the Baron technically did give Granny Aching gold, but it was only the gold-coloured foil on an ounce of Jolly Sailor, the cheap and horrible pipe tobacco that was the only one Granny Aching would ever smoke. She was always in a bad mood if the pedlars were late and she'd run out. You couldn't bribe Granny Aching for all the gold in the world, but you could definitely attract her attention with an ounce of Jolly Sailor.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,222,"['Baron', 'Granny Aching', 'Granny Aching', 'Granny Aching']"
"Things were a lot easier after that, The bailiff was a little less unpleasant when rents were late, the Baron was a little more polite to people, and Tiffany's father said one night after two beers that the Baron had been shown what happens when sheep rise up, and things might be different one day, and her mother hissed at him not to talk like that because you never knew who was listening.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,223,"['Baron', 'Baron']"
"And, one day. Tiffany heard him telling her mother, quietly: ""Twas an old shepherds' trick, that's all. An old ewe will fight like a lion for her lamb, we all know that.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,224,[]
That was how it worked. No magic at all. But that time it had been magic. And it didn't stop being magic just because you found out how it was done...,13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,225,[]
"The Nac Mac Feegles were watching Tiffany carefully, with occasional longing glances at the bottle of Special Sheep Liniment. I haven't even found the witches' school, she thought. I don't know a single spell. I don't even have a pointy hat. My talents are an instinct for making cheese and not running around panicking when things go wrong. Oh, and I've got a toad.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,226,['Tiffany']
"Somehow I don't think the Baron would have a clue how to deal with this. I don't, either, but I think I can be clueless in more sensible ways.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,228,['Baron']
"'The kelda sent us,' said Rob Anybody. 'She sensed the Quin comin'. She kenned there wuz going to be trouble. She tole us, it's gonna be bad, find the new hag who's kin to Granny Aching, she'll ken what to do.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,230,"['Rob Anybody', 'Quin', 'Granny Aching', 'ken']"
"Tiffany looked at the hundreds of expectant faces. Some of the Feegles had feathers in their hair, and necklaces of mole teeth. You couldn't tell someone with half his face dyed dark blue and a sword as big as he was that you weren't really a witch. You couldn't disappoint someone like that.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,231,[]
'And will you help me get my brother back?' she said. The Feegles' expressions didn't change. She tried again. 'Can you help me steal my brother back from the Quin?',13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,232,['Quin']
"'Not... quite,' said Tiffany. 'Can you all just wait a moment? I'll just pack some things,' she said, trying to sound as if she knew what she was doing. She put the cork back on the bottle of Special Sheep Liniment. The Nac Mac Feegles sighed.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,235,['Tiffany']
"She darted back into the kitchen, found a sack, took some bandages and ointments out of the medicine box, added the bottle of Special Sheep Liniment because her father said it always did him good and, as an afterthought, added the book Diseases of the Sheep and picked up the frying pan. Both might come in useful.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,236,[]
"She knew she ought to tell her parents what was happening. But it wouldn't work. It would be 'telling stories'. Anyway, with any luck she could get Wentworth back before she was even missed. But, just in case...",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,238,['Wentworth']
"She kept a diary in the dairy. Cheese needed to be kept track of, and she always wrote down details of the amount of butter she'd made and how much milk she'd been using.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,239,[]
"She turned to a fresh page, picked up her pencil and, with her tongue sticking out of the corner of her mouth, began to write.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,240,[]
"The Nac Mac Feegles gradually reappeared. They didn't obviously step out from behind things, and they certainly didn't pop magically into existence. They appeared in the same way that faces appear in clouds and fires; they seemed to turn up if you just looked hard enough and wanted to see them.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,241,[]
"Tiffany looked up at Rob Anybody, who had shinned up the table leg and was watching the pencil intently, in case it wrote something dangerous.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,248,['Rob Anybody']
"'We dinnae ken it was thee we were lookin' for, mistress. Lots of bigjob women walkin' aroond this farm. We didnae ken it was thee until you caught Daft Wullie.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,250,"['didnae ken', 'Daft Wullie']"
"'Ach, well, you'd have the kennin' of wise stuff like that, mistress,' said Rob Anybody. 'I see you's done wi' the writin', so we'd best be goin'. Ye hae a besom?'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,255,"['Rob Anybody', 'wi', 'Ye']"
"'Fair enough,' said Rob Anybody, sliding back down the table leg. 'Come here, Daft Wullie.' One of the Feegles that looked very much like that morning's egg-thief came and stood by Rob Anybody, and they both bent over slightly. 'If you'd care to step on us, mistress,' said Rob Anybody.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,258,"['Rob Anybody', 'Daft Wullie', 'Rob Anybody', 'Rob Anybody']"
"Before Tiffany could open her mouth, the toad said out of the corner of its mouth, and being a toad that means quite a lot of comer, 'One Feegle can lift a grown man. You couldn't squash one if you tried.'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,259,[]
"Tiffany very cautiously raised a big boot. Daft Wullie ran underneath it, and she felt the boot being pushed upwards. She might as well have trodden on a brick.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,261,['Daft Wullie']
"And then Tiffany was standing up on two pictsies. She felt them moving backwards and forwards underneath her, keeping her balanced. She felt quite secure, though. It was just like wearing really thick soles.",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,265,[]
"'Let's gae,' said Rob Anybody, down below. 'An' don't worry about yon pussycat scraffin' the wee burdies. Some of the lads is stayin' behind to mind things!'",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,266,['Rob Anybody']
"Ratbag crept along a branch. He wasn't a cat who was good at changing the ways he thought. But he was good at finding nests. He'd heard the cheeping from the other end of the garden and even from the bottom of the tree he'd been able to see three little yellow beaks in the nest. Now he advanced, dribbling. Nearly there...",13_The Wee Free Men,3,Chapter 4The Wee Free Men,267,['Ratbag']
"Tiffany flew a few inches above the ground, standing still. Wind rushed around her as the Feegles sped out of the farmyard's top gate and onto the turf of the downs...",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,0,[]
"Pull back, and here is the long green whaleback of the downs. Now she's a pale blue dot against the endless grass, mowed by the sheep to the length of a carpet. But the green sea isn't unbroken. Here and there, humans have been.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,2,[]
"Last year Tiffany had spent three carrots and an apple on half an hour of geology, although she'd been refunded a carrot after explaining to the teacher that 'Geology' shouldn't be spelled on his sign as 'G oily G'. He said that the chalk had been formed under water millions of years before from tiny seashells.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,3,[]
"That made sense to Tiffany. Sometimes you found little fossils in the chalk. But the teacher didn't know much about the flint. You found flints, harder than steel, in chalk, the softest of rocks. Sometimes the shepherds chipped the flints, one flint against another, into knives. Not even the best steel knives could take an edge as sharp as flint.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,4,[]
"And men in what was called on the Chalk 'the olden days' had dug pits for it. They were still there, deep holes in the rolling green, filled with thickets of thorn and brambles.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,5,[]
"Huge, knobbly flints still turned up in the village gardens, too. Sometimes they were larger than a man's head. They often looked like heads, too. They were so melted and twisted and curved that you could look at a flint and see almost anythinga face, a strange animal, a sea monster. Sometimes the more interesting ones would be put on garden walls, for show.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,6,[]
"The old people called those 'calkins', which meant 'chalk children'. They'd always seemed... odd to Tiffany, as if the stone was striving to become alive. Some flints looked like bits of meat, or bones, or something off a butcher's slab, hi the dark, under the sea, it looked as though the chalk had been trying to make the shapes of living creatures.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,7,['calkins']
"There weren't just the chalk pits. Men had been everywhere on the Chalk. There were stone circles, half fallen down, and burial mounds like green pimples where, it was said, chieftains of the olden days had been buried with their treasure. No one fancied digging into them to find out.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,8,[]
"There were odd carvings in the chalk, too, which the shepherds sometimes weeded when they were out on the downs with the flocks and there was not a lot to do. The chalk was only a few inches under the turf. Hoofprints could last a season, but the carvings had lasted for thousands of years. They were pictures of horses and giants, but the strange thing was that you couldn't see them properly from anywhere on the ground. They looked as if they'd been made for viewers in the sky.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,9,['Hoofprints']
"And then there were the weird places, like Old Man's Forge, which was just four big flat rocks placed so they made a kind of half-buried hut in the side of a mound. It was only a few feet deep. It didn't look anything special, but if you shouted your name into it, it was several seconds before the echo came back.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,10,[]
Tiffany left the shearing sheds way behind. No one was watching. Sheared sheep took no notice at all of a girl moving without her feet touching the ground.,13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,12,[]
"The lowlands dropped away behind her and now she was properly on the downs. Only the occasional baa of a sheep or scream of a buzzard disturbed a busy silence, made up of bee buzzes and breezes and the sound of a ton of grass growing every minute.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,13,[]
"They passed some of the mounds without stopping, and ran up and down the sides of shallow valleys without a pause. And it was then that Tiffany saw a landmark ahead.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,15,[]
"It was a small flock of sheep. There were only a few, freshly sheared, but there were always a handful of sheep at this place now. Strays would turn up there, and lambs would find their way to it when they'd lost their mothers.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,16,[]
"There wasn't much to see now, just the iron wheels sinking into the turf and the pot-bellied stove with its short chimney...",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,18,[]
"On the day Granny Aching died, the men had cut and lifted the turf around the hut and stacked it neatly some way away. Then they'd dug a deep hole in the chalk, six feet deep and six feet long, lifting out the chalk in great damp blocks.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,19,['Granny Aching']
"Granny Aching had been wrapped in a woollen blanket, with a tuft of raw wool pinned to it. That was a special shepherd thing. It was there to tell any gods who might get involved that the person being buried there was a shepherd, and spent a lot of time on the hills, and what with lambing and one thing and another couldn't always take much time out for religion, there being no churches or temples up there, and therefore it was generally hoped that the gods would understand and look kindly on them. Granny Aching, it had to be said, had never been seen to pray to anyone or anything in her life, and it was agreed by all that, even now, she wouldn't have any time for a god who didn't understand that lambing came first.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,21,"['Granny Aching', 'Granny Aching']"
"The chalk had been put back over her and Granny Aching, who always said that the hills were in her bones, now had her bones in the hills.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,22,['Granny Aching']
"Then they burned the hut. That wasn't usual, but her father had said that there wasn't a shepherd anywhere on the Chalk who'd use it now.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,23,['Chalk']
"Thunder and Lightning wouldn't come when he called, and he knew better than to be angry, so they were left sitting quite contentedly by the glowing embers of the hut.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,24,[]
"Next day, when the ashes were cold and blowing across the raw chalk, everyone went up onto the downs and with very great care put the turf back, so all that was left to see were the iron wheels on their axles, and the pot-bellied stove.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,25,[]
"At which pointso everyone saidthe two sheepdogs had looked up, their ears pricking, and had trotted away over the turf and were never seen again.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,26,[]
"The pictsies carrying her slowed down gently, and Tiffany flailed her arms as they dropped her onto the grass. The sheep lumbered away slowly, then stopped and turned to watch her.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,27,[]
"'He might have the knowin' of where the Quin went with your wee laddie,' said Rob Anybody soothingly. 'We cannae just rush in, ye ken.'",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,31,"['Quin', 'Rob Anybody']"

"Angry and puzzled, she sat down on one of the rusty wheels and looked at the sky. It was better than looking around. There was Granny Aching's grave somewhere around here, although you couldn't find it now, not precisely. The turf had healed.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,35,"[""Granny Aching's""]"
"There were a few little clouds above her and nothing else at all, except the distant circling dots of the buzzards.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,36,[]
"There were always buzzards over the Chalk. The shepherds had taken to calling them Granny Aching's chickens, and some of them called clouds like those up there today 'Granny's little lambs'. And Tiffany knew that even her father called the thunder 'Granny Aching cussin' '.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,37,"[""Granny Aching's"", 'Granny', 'Tiffany', 'Granny Aching']"
"And it was said that some of the shepherds, if wolves were troublesome in the winter, or a prize ewe had got lost, would go to the site of the old hut in the hills and leave an ounce of Jolly Sailor tobacco, just in case...",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,38,[]
"Tiffany hesitated. Then she shut her eyes. I want that to be true, she whispered to herself. I want to know that other people think she hasn't really gone, too.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,39,[]
"She picked it up. It looked quite fresh, so it had probably been there for only a few days. There was the Jolly Sailor on the front, with his big grin and big yellow rain hat and big beard, with big blue waves crashing behind him.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,41,[]
"Tiffany had learned about the sea from the Jolly Sailor wrappings. She'd heard it was big, and roared. There was a tower in the sea, which was a lighthouse that carried a big light on it at night to stop boats crashing into the rocks. In the pictures the beam of the lighthouse was a brilliant white. She knew about it so well she'd dreamed about it, and had woken up with the roar of the sea in her ears.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,42,[]
"She'd heard one of her uncles say that if you looked at the tobacco label upside down then part of the hat and the sailor's ear and a bit of his collar made up a picture of a woman with no clothes on, but Tiffany had never been able to make it out and couldn't see what the point would be in any case.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,43,[]
"She carefully pulled the label off the packet, and sniffed at it. It smelled of Granny. She felt her eyes begin to fill with tears. She'd never cried for Granny Aching before, never. She'd cried for dead lambs and cut fingers and for not getting her own way, but never for Granny. It hadn't seemed right.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,44,"['Granny', 'Granny Aching', 'Granny']"
"It was the smell. Granny Aching smelled of sheep, turpentine and Jolly Sailor tobacco. The three smells mixed together and became one smell which was, to Tiffany, the smell of the Chalk. It followed Granny Aching like a cloud, and it meant warmth, and silence, and a space around which the whole world revolved...",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,46,"['Granny Aching', 'Granny Aching']"
"'Dinnae fash yersel', mistress,' said Rob Anybody. The bird curved up at the bottom of its dive and as it climbed again a dot dropped from it. As it fell it seemed to grow two wings and start to spin like a sycamore bract, which slowed down the fall somewhat.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,50,['Rob Anybody']
"It was a pictsie, still spinning madly when he hit the turf a few feet away, where he fell over. He got up, swearing loudly, and fell over again. The swearing continued.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,51,[]

"It wasn't what she'd been expecting. What she had been expecting was more like 'Ach, ye cannae do that, a wee lass like you, oh dearie us no!'

"Snow formed on the ground. It didn't fall, it... did the opposite of melting, rising up fast until the Nac Mac Feegles were waist deep, and then up to their necks. Some of the smaller ones began to disappear, and there was muffled cursing from under the snow.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,96,['Snow']

'Thank you! You've been very helpful!' Tiffany dropped him back into her pocket and pulled her frying pan out of her sack.,13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,104,[]
"It wasn't going to be good enough, she knew that. The black dogs were big, and their eyes were flames, and when they opened their mouths to snarl she could see the light glint on steel. She'd never been afraid of dogs, but these dogs weren't from anywhere outside of a nightmare.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,105,[]
"There were three of them, but they circled so that no matter how she turned she could only see two at once. She knew it would be the one behind her that attacked first.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,106,[]

"and took charge of her legs. She dived between two of the dogs and ran towards the distant green. There was a growl of triumph behind her and she heard the crunch of paws on snow. The green didn't seem to be getting nearer. She heard yells from the pictsies and a snarl that turned into a wail, but there was something behind her as she jumped over the last of the snow and rolled on the warm turf.",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,114,[]
"No eyes of fire, no teeth of razors. Not here, not in the real world, on the home turf. It was blind here and blood was already dripping from its mouth. You shouldn't jump with a mouthful of razors...",13_The Wee Free Men,4,Chapter 5  The Green Sea,116,[]

"There was a fight going on back in the snow. It was flying up like a mist, but she could see two dark shapes in the middle, spinning around and snapping.

"'You're dead?' said Tiffany. She looked around. Feegles were picking themselves up and grumbling, but no one was going 'Waily waily waily.' And Rob Anybody wasn't making any sense at all.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,0,['Rob Anybody']
"'Oh, they've gone back to the land o' the livin',' said Rob Anybody cheerfully. 'It's nae as good as this one, but they'll bide fine and come back before too long. No sense in grievin'.'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,2,['Rob Anybody']
"The Achings were not very religious, but Tiffany thought she knew how things ought to go, and they started out with the idea that you were alive and not dead yet.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,3,['Tiffany']
"'Ach, no, mistress,' said Rob, helping another pictsie to his feet. 'We wuz alive. And we wuz good boys back in the land o' the livin', and so when we died there we wuz borned into this place.'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,5,['Rob']
'You mean... you think... that you sort of died somewhere else and then came here?' said Tiffany. 'You mean this is like...heaven?',13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,6,['Tiffany']
"'Ach, well, mebbe all you humans wuz good in the Last World, too,' said Rob Anybody generously. 'I'll just round up the lads, mistress.'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,15,['Rob Anybody']
"'Oh. We survived,' it said. 'Amazing. There are very definite grounds for an action against the owner of those dogs, by the way.'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,17,[]
"'I... I... don't know,' said the toad. 'The thought just popped into my head. Perhaps I knew something about dogs when I was human?'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,19,[]
"'Well, that can't be right! You're supposed to be alive here and then die and end up in some heaven somewhere else!'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,22,[]
"'Well, that's just saying the same thing in a different way, isn't it? Anyway, lots of warrior tribes think that when they die they go to a heavenly land somewhere,' said the toad. 'You know, where they can drink and fight and feast for ever? So maybe this is theirs.'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,23,[]
"'So? It's what they believe. Besides, they're only small. Maybe the universe is a bit crowded and they have to put heavens anywhere there's room? I'm a toad, so you'll appreciate that I'm having to guess a lot here. Maybe they're just wrong. Maybe you're just wrong. Maybe I'm just wrong.'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,25,[]
"A small foot kicked Tiffany on the boot. 'We'd be best be moving on, mistress,' said Rob Anybody. He had a dead Feegle over his shoulder. Quite a few of the others were carrying bodies, too. 'Er... are you going to bury them?' said Tiffany. 'Aye, they dinnae need these ol' bodies noo an' it's no' tidy to leave 'em lyin' aboot,' said Rob Anybody. 'Besides, if the bigjobs find little wee skulls and bones aroound they'll start to wonder, and we don't want anyone pokin' aboot. Savin' your presence, mistress,' he added.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,26,"['Rob Anybody', 'Feegle', 'Tiffany', 'Rob Anybody', 'Savin']"
"'No, that's very, er... practical thinking,' said Tiffany, giving up. The Feegle pointed to a distant mound with a thicket of thorn trees growing on it. A lot of the mounds had thickets on them. The trees took advantage of the deeper soil. It was said to be unlucky to cut them down.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,27,[]
"'Ach, aye, there's some of dead kingie in the chamber next door but he's nae trouble,' said Rob. 'Dinnae fret, there's nae skelingtons or any such in oour bit. It's quite roomy, we've done it up a treat.'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,30,['Rob']
"Tiffany looked up at the endless blue sky over the endlessly green downland. It was all so peaceful again, a world away from headless men and big savage dogs.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,31,[]
"What if I hadn't taken Wentworth down to the river? she thought. What would I be doing now? Getting on with the cheese, I suppose...",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,32,[]
"I never knew about all this. I never knew I lived in heaven, even if it's only heaven to a clan of little blue men. I didn't know about people who flew on buzzards.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,33,[]
"'Ach, ye prob'ly ken the place well,' said Rob Anybody. As they grew nearer the mound, Tiffany thought she could smell smoke in the air.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,36,"['ken', 'Rob Anybody', 'Tiffany']"
'Aye. But it's a no' a name I'll say in open air. It's a name to be whispered in a safe place. I'll not say it under this sky.',13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,38,[]
"It was too big to be a rabbit hole and badgers didn't live up here, but the entrance to the mound was tucked amongst the thorn roots and no one would have thought it was anything but the home of some kind of an animal.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,39,[]
"Tiffany was slim, but even so she had to take off her apron and crawl on her stomach under the thorns to reach it. And it still needed several Feegles to push her through.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,40,[]
"At least it didn't smell bad and, once you were through the hole, it opened up a lot. Really, the entrance was just a disguise. Underneath, the space was the size of quite a large room, open in the centre but with Feegle-sized galleries around the walls from floor to ceiling. They were crowded with pictsies of all sizes, washing clothes, arguing, sewing and, here and there, fighting, and doing everything as loudly as possible. Some had hair and beards tinged with white. Much younger ones, only a few inches tall, were running around with no clothes on, and yelling at one another at the tops of their little voices. After a couple of years of helping to bring up Wentworth, Tiffany knew what that was all about.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,41,[]
"The squabbling, bustling crowds parted to let her through. She came up to Tiffany's ankle. She was prettier than the male Feegles, although the world was full of things prettier than, say, Daft Wullie. But, like them, she had red hair and an expression of determination.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,44,"['Feegles', 'Daft Wullie']"
"'Nae, nae, but the kelda knows the way of the Quin. She didnae want you to fash yersel' on that score.'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,50,"['Quin', 'didnae']"
"Fion turned round with a swirl of skirts, strode back across the chalk floor as if she was a queen herself, and disappeared behind a large round stone that leaned against the far wall.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,53,[]
"Tiffany, without looking down, carefully lifted the toad out of her pocket and held it close to her lips. 'Am I fashing myself?' she whispered.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,54,[]
"'You would tell me if I was, wouldn't you?' said Tiffany urgently. 'It'd be terrible if everyone could see I was fashing and I didn't know.'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,56,['Tiffany']
"'Yes, I thought it was probably something like that,' lied Tiffany. 'Can you sit on my shoulder? I think I might need some help here.'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,60,['Tiffany']
"The ranks of the Nac Mac Feegle were watching her with interest, but at the moment it appeared that she had nothing to do but hurry up and wait. She sat down carefully, drumming her fingers on her knees.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,61,[]
"She looked down. Rob Anybody Feegle and a few of the pictsies she'd already met were lurking there, watching her nervously.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,63,['Rob']
"'Very... cosy,' said Tiffany, because that was better than saying 'How sooty' or 'How delightfully noisy'. She added: 'Do you cook for all of you on that little fire?'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,64,[]
"The big space in the centre held a small fire, under a hole in the roof which let the smoke get lost in the bushes above and in return brought in a little extra light.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,65,[]
"'What was Wullie saying about roasting ""big stuff""?' Tiffany demanded. 'You roast ""big stuff in the chalk pit? Is this the kind of big stuff that goes ""baa""? Because that's the only big stuff you'll find in these hills!'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,70,['Wullie']
"She kneeled down on the grimy floor and brought her face to within an inch of Rob Anybody's face, which was grinning madly and sweating.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,71,"[""Rob Anybody's""]"
"'No Aching ship ever got caught by wolves!' Rob Anybody gabbled. 'No foxes took an Aching lamb, right? Nor no lamb e'er had its een pecked out by corbies, not wi' Hamish up in the sky!'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,79,"['Rob', 'wi', 'Hamish']"
"'Yes, yes, I know what they do,' said Tiffany. She calmed down a little. 'Oh. I see. You kept away the crows and wolves and foxes for Granny, yes?'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,82,['Granny']
"'Aye, they kebabs up a treat, but they're no' as good as a ship, tho... mmph mmph...' Wullie managed, before a hand was clamped over his mouth again.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,84,['Wullie']
"'From a hag ye only tak' what ye's given,' said Rob Anybody, holding his struggling brother firmly. 'Since she's gone, though, weel... we tak' the odd old ewe that would've deid anywa', but ne'er one wi' the Aching mark, on my honour.'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,85,"['Rob Anybody', 'wi']"
"Rob Anybody beamed. 'Aye!' he said. 'An' I got a lot of good big reputation to protect there! That's the truth o' it, mistress. We keeps an eye on the ships of the hills, in mem'ry o' Granny Aching, an' in return we tak' what is hardly worth a thing.'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,87,"['Rob', 'Granny Aching']"
"Tiffany took a deep breath, not a wise move in a Feegle colony. Rob Anybody's nervous grin made him look like a pumpkin man faced with a big spoon.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,89,"[""Rob Anybody's""]"
"'Ach, I forgot about that,' squeaked Rob Anybody. 'But we allus wait a few days in case she comes to collect it hersel'. Ye can ne'er tell wi' a hag, after all. And we do mind the ships, mistress. And she wouldna grudge us, mistress! Many's a night she'd share a pipe wi' the kelda outside o' her house on the wheelies! She'd not be one to let good baccy get all rainy! Please, mistress!'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,91,"['Rob', 'Ye', 'wi']"
'When we find lost lambs and suchlike we drives 'em here for when the shepherds come lookin' ' Rob Anybody added anxiously.,13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,93,['Rob']
"What did I think happened? Tiffany thought. Did I think she'd come back for a packet of Jolly Sailor? Did I think she was still somehow walking the hills, looking after the sheep? Did I think she... was still here, watching for lost lambs?",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,94,[]
"Yes! I want that to be true. I don't want to think she's just... gone. Someone like Granny Aching can't just... not be there any more. And I want her back so much, because she didn't know how to talk to me and I was too scared to talk to her, and so we never talked and we turned silence into something to share.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,95,['Granny Aching']
"I know nothing about her. Just some books, and some stories she tried to tell me, and things I didn't understand, and I remember big red soft hands and that smell. I never knew who she really was. I mean, she must have been nine too, once. She was Sarah Grizzel. She got married and had children, two of them in the shepherding hut. She must've done all sorts of things I don't know about.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,96,['Sarah Grizzel']
"And into Tiffany's mind, as it always did sooner or later, came the figure of the blue and white china shepherdess, swirling in red mists of shame...",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,97,[]
"Tiffany's father took her to the fair at the town of Yelp one day not long before her seventh birthday, when the farm had some rams to sell. That was a ten-mile journey, the furthest she'd ever been. It was off the Chalk. Everything looked different. There were far more fenced fields and lots of cows and the buildings had tiled roofs instead of thatch. She considered that this was foreign travel.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,98,[]
"Granny Aching had never been there, said her father on the way. She hated leaving the Chalk, he said. She said it made her dizzy.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,99,['Granny Aching']
"It was a great day. Tiffany was sick on candyfloss, had her fortune told by a little old lady who said that many, many men would want to marry her, and won the shepherdess, which was made of china painted in white and blue.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,100,[]
"She was the star prize on the hoop-la stall but Tiffany's father had said that it was all cheating, because the base was so wide that not one throw in a million could ever drop the hoop right over it.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,101,[]
"She'd thrown the ring any old how, and it had been the one in a million. The stallholder hadn't been very happy about it landing over the shepherdess rather than the gimcrack rubbish on the rest of the stall. He handed it over when her father spoke sharply to him, though, and she'd hugged it all the way home on the cart, while the stars came out.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,102,[]
Next morning she'd proudly presented it to Granny Aching. The old woman had taken it very carefully in her wrinkled hands and stared at it for some time.,13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,103,['Granny Aching']
"Granny Aching had probably never heard of shepherdesses. People who cared for sheep on the Chalk were all called shepherds, and that was all there was to it. And this beautiful creature was as much unlike Granny Aching as anything could be.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,105,"['Granny Aching', 'Chalk', 'Granny Aching']"
"The china shepherdess had an old-fashioned long dress, with the bulgy bits at the side that made it look as though she had saddlebags in her knickers. There were blue ribbons all over the dress, and all over the rather showy straw bonnet, and on the shepherd's crook, which was a lot more curly than any crook Tiffany had ever seen.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,106,[]
"This wasn't a shepherdess who'd ever worn big old boots stuffed with wool, and tramped the hills in the howling wind with the sleet being driven along like nails. She'd never tried in that dress to pull out a ram who'd got his horns tangled in a thorn patch. This wasn't a shepherdess who'd kept up with the champion shearer for seven hours, sheep for sheep, until the air was hazy with grease and wool and blue with cussing, and the champion gave up because he couldn't cuss sheep as well as Granny Aching. No self-respecting sheepdog would ever 'come by' or 'walk up' for a simpering girl with saddlebags in her pants. It was a lovely thing but it was a joke of a shepherdess, made by someone who'd probably never seen a sheep up close.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,108,['Granny Aching']
"What had Granny Aching thought about it? Tiffany couldn't guess. She'd seemed happy, because it's the job of grandmothers to be happy when grandchildren give them things. She'd put it up on her shelf, and then taken Tiffany on her knee and called her 'my little jiggit' in a nervous sort of way, which she did when she was trying to be grandmotherly.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,109,"['Granny Aching', 'Tiffany']"
"Sometimes, in the rare times Granny was down at the farm, Tiffany would see her take down the statue and stare at it. But if she saw Tiffany watching she'd put it back quickly, and pretend she'd meant to pick up the sheep book.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,110,"['Granny', 'Tiffany']"
"Perhaps, Tiffany thought wretchedly, the old lady had seen it as a sort of insult. Perhaps she thought she was being told that this was what a shepherdess should look like. She shouldn't be an old lady in a muddy dress and big boots, with an old sack around her shoulders to keep the rain off. A shepherdess should sparkle like a starry night. Tiffany hadn't meant to, she'd never meant to, but perhaps she had been telling Granny that she wasn't... right.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,111,"['Tiffany', 'Granny']"
"And then a few months after that Granny had died, and in the years since then everything had gone wrong. Wentworth had been born, and then the Baron's son had vanished, and then there had been that bad winter when Mrs Snapperly died in the snow.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,112,"['Granny', 'Wentworth', 'Baron', 'Mrs Snapperly']"
"Tiffany kept worrying about the statue. She couldn't talk about it. Everyone else was busy, or not interested. Everyone was edgy. They'd have said that worrying about a silly statue was... silly.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,113,[]
"She remembered that the old lady would smile oddly, sometimes, when she looked at the statue. If only she'd said something. But Granny liked silence.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,116,['Granny']
"And now it turned out that she'd made friends with a lot of little blue men, who walked the hills looking after the sheep, because they liked her, too. Tiffany blinked.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,117,[]
"It made a kind of sense. In memory of Granny Aching, the men left the tobacco. And in memory of Granny Aching, the Nac Mac Feegle minded the sheep. It all worked, even if it wasn't magic. But it took Granny away.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,118,"['Granny Aching', 'Granny Aching', 'Granny']"
"'Mr Feegle, you can please take your hand away from his mouth,' said Tiffany. Daft Wullie was released. Rob Anybody had looked worried, but Daft Wullie was terrified. He dragged his bonnet off and stood holding it in his hands, as if it was some kind of shield.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,123,"['Feegle', 'Daft Wullie', 'Rob Anybody', 'Daft Wullie']"
"'She dinnae turn me intae a pismire!' said Daft Wullie, grinning happily at the rest of the pictsies. 'Hey, lads, I talked wi' the hag and she dinnae e'en look at me crosswise! She smiled at me!' He beamed at Tiffany and went on: 'An' d'ye ken, mistress, that if'n you hold the baccy label upside-doon then part o' the sailor's bonnet and his ear became a lady wi' nae mmph mmph...'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,133,"['Daft Wullie', 'wi', 'wi', 'nae mmph']"
"Some of the Feegles were busy on the far side of the chamber. What Tiffany had thought was a strange round stone was being rolled aside, revealing a large hole.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,137,['Tiffany']
"Now her ears squelched and felt as though all the wax was running out. The Feegles were forming up in two rows, leading to the hole.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,138,[]
"There was a Feegle walking out of the hole from which came, now that Tiffany's eyes had become accustomed to the gloom, a faint golden light.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,143,[]
"The newcomer's hair was white instead of red and, while he was tall for a pictsie, he was as skinny as a twig. He was holding some sort of fat skin bag, bristling with pipes.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,144,[]
"'High-pitched, see?' said the toad. 'Of course, the pictsies hear sounds differently than humans do. He's probably their battle poet, too.'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,147,[]
"'No, no. He recites poems that frighten the enemy. Remember how important words are to the Nac Mac Feegle? Well, when a well-trained gonnagle starts to recite, the enemy's ears explode. Ah, it looks as though they're ready for you...'",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,149,[]
The piper had stopped playing and was standing respectfully beside the hole. Tiffany felt hundreds of bright little eyes watching her.,13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,151,[]
"The pictsies watched her carefully as she lay down again and crawled through the hole behind the stone, the toad hanging on tightly. As she got closer she realized that what she'd thought was a stone was an old round shield, green-blue and corroded with age. The hole it had covered was indeed wide enough for her to go through, but she had to leave her legs outside because it was impossible to get all of her into the room beyond. One reason was the bed, small though it was, which held the kelda. The other reason was that what the room was mostly full of, piled up around the walls and spilling across the floor, was gold.",13_The Wee Free Men,5,Chapter 6The Shepherdess,155,[]
"Tiffany thought a lot about words, in the long hours of churning butter. 'Onomatopoeic', she'd discovered in the dictionary, meant words that sounded like the noise of the thing they were describing, like 'cuckoo'. But she thought there should be a word meaning 'a word that sounds like the noise a thing would make if that thing made a noise even though, actually, it doesn't, but would if it did'.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,1,['Onomatopoeic']
"Glint, for example. If light made a noise as it reflected off a distant window, it'd go 'glint!' And the light of tinsel, all those little glints chiming together, would make a noise like 'glitterglitter'. 'Gleam' was a clean, smooth noise from a surface that intended to shine all day. And 'glisten' was the soft, almost greasy sound of something rich and oily.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,2,[]
"The little cave contained all of these at once. There was only one candle, which smelled of sheep fat, but gold plates and cups gleamed, glistened, glinted and glittered the light back and forth until the one little flame filled the air with a light that even smelled expensive.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,3,[]
"The gold surrounded the bed of the kelda, who was sitting up against a pile of pillows. She was much, much fatter than the male pictsies; she looked as if she'd been made of round balls of slightly squashy dough, and was the colour of chestnuts.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,4,[]
"Her eyes were closed as Tiffany slid in, but they flicked open the moment she'd stopped pulling herself forward. They were the sharpest eyes she'd ever seen, much sharper even than Miss Tick's.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,5,[]
"'Aye. I mean, yes,' said the kelda, and the round face became a mass of lines as the kelda smiled. 'What was your name, now?'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,8,[]
"""Tiffany, er, Kelda.' Fion had turned up from some other part of the cave and was sitting down on a stool by the bed, watching Tiffany intently with a disapproving expression.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,9,['Tiffany']
"'Ach, what people mean to do and what is done are two different things,' said the kelda. Her little eyes shone. 'Your wee brother is... safe, child. Ye could say he's safer where he is noo than he has ever been. No mortal ills can touch him. The Quin would nae harm a hair o' his heid. And there's the evil o' it. Help me up here, girl.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,12,"['Ye', 'Quin']"
"'Where wuz I?' the kelda continued. 'Ah, the wee laddie. Aye, ye could say he bides well where he is, in the Quin's own country. But I daresay there's a mother grievin'?'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,14,['Quin']
"Tiffany felt the words 'Yes, of course' trot automatically onto her tongue. She also knew that it would be very stupid to let them go any further. The little old woman's dark eyes were seeing right into her head.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,17,[]
"'Aye, you're a born hag, right enough,' said the kelda, holding her gaze. 'Ye've got that little bitty bit inside o' you that holds on, right? The bitty bit that watches the rest o' ye. 'Tis the First Sight and Second Thoughts ye have, and 'tis a wee gift an' a big curse to ye. You see and hear what others canna', the world opens up its secrets to ye, but ye 're always like the person at the party with the wee drink in the corner who cannae join in. There's a little bitty bit inside ye that willnae melt and flow. Ye're Sarah Aching's line, right enough. The lads fetched the right one.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,18,['Sarah Aching']
"Tiffany didn't know what to say to that, so she didn't say anything. The kelda watched her, eyes twinkling, until Tiffany felt awkward.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,19,[]
"'She's bending her mind to ye,' said the kelda. 'When she does, something of her world passes into this one. Mebbe she just wants to test you.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,23,[]
"'To see how good you are. Ye're the hag noo, the witch that guards the edges and the gateways. So wuz yer granny, although she wouldnae ever call hersel' one. And so wuz I until noo, and I'll pass the duty to ye. She'll ha' to get past ye, if she wants this land. Ye have the First Sight and the Second Thoughts, just like yer granny. That's rare in a bigjob.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,25,['Ye']
"'Ach, no. That's typical bigjob thinking. First Sight is when you can see what's really there, not what your heid tells you ought to be there. Ye saw Jenny, ye saw the horseman, ye saw them as real thingies. Second sight is dull sight, it's seeing only what you expect to see. Most bigjobs ha' that. Listen to me, because I'm fadin' noo and there's a lot ye dinnae ken. Ye think this is the only world? That is a good thought for sheep and mortals who dinnae open their eyes. Because in truth there are more worlds than stars in the sky. Understand? They are everywhere, big and small, close as your skin. They are everywhere. Some ye can see an' some ye cannae but there are doors, Tiffan. They might be a hill or a tree or a stone or a turn in the road or they might e'en be a thought in yer heid, but they are there, all aroound ye. You'll have to learn to see 'em, because you walk amongst them and dinnae know it. And some of them... is poisonous.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,27,"['Ye', 'Jenny', 'Ye', 'Tiffan']"
"The kelda stared at Tiffany for a moment and then continued: 'Ye asked why the Quin should take your boy? The Quin likes children. She has none o' her own. She dotes on them. She'll give the wee boy everything he wants, too.Only what he wants.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,28,"['Ye', 'Quin', 'Quin']"
"'Is that so? An' did ye gi' them to him?' said the kelda, as if she was looking into Tiffany's mind. 'But what he needs is love an' care an' teachin' an' people sayin' ""no"" to him sometimes an' things o' that nature. He needs to be growed up strong. He willnae get that fra' the Quin. He'll get sweeties. For ever.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,30,['Quin']
"'But I see he has a sister willin' to take any pains to bring him back,' said the little old woman, taking her eyes away from Tiffany. 'What a lucky wee boy he is, to be so fortunate. Ye ken how to be strong, do ye?'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,32,['Ye ken']
"'Good. D'ye ken how to be weak? Can ye bow to the gale, can ye bend to the storm?' The kelda smiled again. 'Nay, ye neednae answer that. The wee burdie always has tae leap from the nest to see if it can fly. Anyway, ye have the feel o' Sarah Aching about ye, and no word e'en o' mine could turn her once she had set her mind to something. Ye're no' a woman yet, and that's no bad thing, because where ye'll be goin' is easy for children, hard for adults.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,34,"[""D'ye ken"", 'Sarah Aching']"
"'Aye. I can feel it noo, lyin' over this one like a fog, as far awa' as the other side o' a mirror. I'm weakenin', Tiffan. I cannae defend this place. So here is my bargain, child. I'll point ye towards the Quin an', in return, ye'll tak' over as kelda.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,36,"['Tiffan', 'Quin', ""ye'll tak'""]"
"That surprised Fion as much as Tiffany. Her head shot up sharply and her mouth opened, but the kelda had raised a wrinkled hand.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,37,[]
"'When ye are a kelda somewhere, my girl, ye'll expect people to do your biddin'. So dinnae give me the argument. That's my offer, Tiffan. Ye won't get a better.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,38,['Tiffan']
"'She's a bit on the large side, aye,' said the kelda. 'Dinnae fret, Tiffan. It willnae be for long. I just need ye to mind things for a wee while. Mind the land like yer granny did, and mind my boys. Then when yer wee boy is back home, Hamish'll fly up to the mountains and let it be known that the Chalk Hill clan has want o' a kelda. We've got a good place here, and the girls'll come flockin'. What d'ye say?'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,42,['Tiffan']
"'Aye, I am,' said the kelda. 'But a daughter cannae run her mother's clan, ye know that. Ye're a dutiful girl, Fion, but it's time ye were pickin' your bodyguard and going awa' seeking a clan of your own. Ye cannae stay here.' The kelda looked up at Tiffany again. 'Will ye, Tiffan?' She held up a thumb the size of a match head and waited.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,44,"[""Ye're"", 'Fion', 'Tiffan']"
"'The thinkin',' said the kelda, still holding up her thumb. 'My lads are good lads, there's none braver. But they think their heids is most useful as weapons. That's lads for ye. We pictsies aren't like you big folk, ye ken. Ye have many sisters? Fion here has none. She's my only daughter. A kelda might be blessed wi' only one daughter in her whole life, but she'll have hundreds and hundreds o' sons.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,46,"['Ye', 'wi']"
"'Oh aye,' said the kelda, smiling. 'Except for a few o' my brothers who travelled here with me when I came to be kelda. Oh, dinna look so astonished. The bairns are really wee when they're borned, like little peas in a pod. And they grow up fast.' She sighed. 'But sometimes I think all the brains is saved for the daughters. They're good boys, but they're no' great thinkers. You'll have to help them help ye.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,48,['dinna']
"'I recall Sarah Aching talkin' aboot ye,' said the kelda. 'She said ye were a strange wee one, always watchin' and listenin'. She said ye had a heid full o' words that ye ne'er spoke aloud. She wondered what'd become o' ye. Time for ye to find out, aye?'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,52,['Sarah Aching']
"Aware of Fion glaring at her, and maybe because of Fion glaring at her, Tiffany licked her thumb and touched it gently against the kelda's tiny thumb.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,53,['Tiffany']
"'It is done, then,' said the kelda. She lay back suddenly, and just as suddenly seemed to shrink. There were more lines in her face now. 'Never let it be said I left my sons wi'oot a kelda to mind them,' she muttered. 'Now I can go back to the Last World. Tiffan is the kelda for now, Fion. In her hoose, ye'll do what she says.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,54,['Tiffan']
"The kelda sagged. She beckoned Tiffany closer, and in a weaker voice said: 'There. 'Tis done. And now for my part o' the bargain. Listen. Find... the place where the time disnae fit. There's the way in. It'll shine out to ye. Bring him back to ease yer puir mother's heart and mebbe also your ain head'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,56,['ain']
"The kelda struggled to sit up again. 'The best thing humans ever made,' she said. 'I'll just have a large wee drop, Fion.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,62,[]
"'Ach, weel, for a drop of Sarah Aching's Special Sheep Liniment I'll risk a curl or two,' said the old kelda. She took from Fion a leather cup about the size of a thimble, and held it up.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,64,"[""Sarah Aching's""]"
"'Aye, it's a lang time since I tasted this brose,' she said. 'Your granny and I used to ha' a sip or two in front o' the fire on cold nights...'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,70,[]
"Tiffany saw it clearly in her head, Granny Aching and this little fat woman, sitting around the potbellied stove in the hut on wheels, while the sheep grazed under the stars...",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,71,['Granny Aching']
"'Ah, ye can see it,' said the kelda. 'I can feel yer eyes on me. That's the First Sight workin'.' She lowered the cup. 'Fion, go and fetch Rob Anybody and William the gonnagle.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,72,"['Rob', 'William']"
"'I dare say there's room to wriggle past,' said the old kelda in the kind of calm voice that said a stormy voice could follow if people didn't do what they were told.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,74,[]
"'Ye ken anyone who keeps bees?' said the kelda. When Tiffany nodded the little old woman went on, 'Then you'll know why we dinnae have many daughters. You cannae ha' two quins in one hive wi'oot a big fight. Fion must take her pick o' them that will follow her and seek a clan that needs a kelda. That is our way. She thinks there's another way, as gels sometimes do. Be careful o' her.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,76,"['Ye ken', 'Tiffany']"
"Tiffany felt something move past her, and Rob Anybody and the bard came into the room. There was more rustling and whispering, too. An unofficial audience was gathering outside.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,77,['Rob Anybody']
"When things had settled down a little, the old kelda said: 'It is a bad thing for a clan to be left wi'oot a kelda to watch o'er it e'en for an hour. So Tiffan will be your kelda until a new one can be fetched.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,78,['Tiffan']
"'Aye. The songs say twice before,' said William. He frowned, and added: 'Or you could say it was three times if you include the time when the Quin was'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,81,"['William', 'Quin']"
"'Aye, and ye saw the wee hag stare the heidless horseman in the eyes he hasnae got,' said Rob Anybody. 'Not many people can do that!'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,85,['Rob Anybody']
"'And I have been your kelda for seventy years and my words cannae be gainsaid,' said the old kelda. 'So the choice is made. I tell ye, too, that ye'll help her steal back her wee baby brother. That is the fate I lay on you all in memory of me and Sarah Aching.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,86,['Sarah Aching']
"She lay back in her bed, and in a quieter voice added, 'An' now I would have the gonnagle play The Bonny Flowers, and hope to see yez all again in the Last World. To Tiffan, I say, be wary.' The kelda took a deep breath. 'Somewhere, a' stories are real, a' songs are true...'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,87,['Tiffan']
The old kelda fell silent. William the gonnagle inflated the bag of his mousepipes and blew into one of the tubes. Tiffany felt the bubbling in her ears of music too high-pitched to hear.,13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,88,['William']
"Rob Anybody turned and looked up at Tiffany, his eyes running with tears. 'Could I just ask ye to go out intae the big chamber, Kelda?' he said, quietly. 'We ha' things to do, ye ken how it is...'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,90,"['Rob Anybody', 'ye ken']"
"Tiffany nodded and, with great care, feeling pictsies scuttle out of her way, backed out of the room. She found a corner where she didn't seem to be in anyone's way and sat there with her back to the wall.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,91,[]
"She'd expected a lot of 'waily waily waily' but it seemed the death of the kelda was too serious for that. Some Feegles were crying, and some were staring at nothing and, as the news spread, the tiered hall filled up with a wretched, sobbing silence...",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,92,[]
"Someone went up every day with fresh bread and milk and scraps for the dogs. It didn't need to be quite so often, but Tiffany had heard her parents talking and her father had said, 'We ought to keep an eye on Mam now.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,94,['Mam']
"But she'd noticed the silence. It was no longer the silence of many little noises, but a dome of quiet all around the hut.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,96,[]
"She'd felt coldness spread though her. It even had a soundit was like a thin, sharp musical note. It had a voice, too. Her own voice. It was saying: It's too late, tears are no good, no time to say anything, there are things to be done...",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,98,[]
"And... then she fed the dogs, who were waiting patiently for their breakfast. It would have helped if they'd done something soppy, like whine or lick Granny's face, but they hadn't. And still Tiffany heard the voice in her mind: No tears, don't cry. Don't cry for Granny Aching.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,99,"['Granny', 'Tiffany', 'Granny Aching']"
"She'd tidied up the shed. Besides the bed and the stove there really wasn't much there. There was the clothes sack and the big water barrel and the food box, and that was it. Oh, stuff to do with sheep was all over the placepots and bottles and sacks and knives and shearsbut there was nothing there that said a person lived here, unless you counted the hundreds of blue and yellow Jolly Sailor wrappers pinned on one wall.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,101,[]
"It was very unusual for Granny Aching to say more than a sentence. She used words as if they cost money. But there'd been one day when she'd taken food up to the hut, and Granny had told her a story. A sort of a story. She'd unwrapped the tobacco, and looked at the wrapper, and then looked at Tiffany with that slightly puzzled look she used, and said: 'I must've looked at a thousand o' these things, and I never once saw his bo-ut.' That was how she pronounced 'boat'.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,103,"['Granny Aching', 'Granny']"
"Of course Tiffany had rushed to have a look at this label, but she couldn't see any boat, any more than she could see the naked lady.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,104,[]
"'That's 'cos the bo-ut is just where you can't see it,' Granny had said. 'He's got a bo-ut for chasin' the great white whale fish on the salt sea. He's always chasing it, all round the world. It's called Mopey. It's a beast like a big cliff of chalk, I heard tell In a book.' 'Why's he chasing it?' Tiffany had asked. 'To catch it,' Granny had said. 'But he never will, the reason being, the world is round like a big plate and so is the sea and so they 're chasing one another, so it is almost like he is chasing hisself. Ye never want to go to sea, jiggit. That's where worse things happen. Everyone says that. You stop along here, where's the hills is in yer bones.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,105,"['Granny', 'Granny', 'Ye']"
"And that was it. It was one of the very few times Granny Aching had ever said anything to Tiffany that wasn't, in some way, about sheep. It was the only time she ever acknowledged that there was a world beyond the Chalk. Tiffany used to dream about the Jolly Sailor chasing the whale fish in his boat. And sometimes the whale fish would chase her, but the Jolly Sailor always arrived in his mighty ship just in time and their chase would start again.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,106,['Granny Aching']
"Sometimes she'd run to the lighthouse, and wake up just as the door swung open. She'd never seen the sea, but one of the neighbours had an old picture on the wall that showed a lot of men clinging to a raft in what looked like a huge lake full of waves. She hadn't been able to see the lighthouse at all.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,107,[]
"And Tiffany had sat by the narrow bed and thought about Granny Aching, and about the little girl Sarah Grizzel very carefully painting the flowers in the book, and about the world losing its centre.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,108,"['Granny Aching', 'Sarah Grizzel']"
"She missed the silence. What there was now wasn't the same kind of silence there had been before. Granny's silence was warm, and brought you inside. Granny Aching might sometimes have had trouble remembering the difference between children and lambs, but in her silence you were welcome and belonged. All you had to bring was a silence of your own.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,109,"['Granny', 'Granny Aching']"
Someone was tapping politely on her boot. She opened her eyes and saw the toad. It was holding a small rock in its mouth. It spat it out.,13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,112,[]
"'Well, if you hit your head on this low ceiling you would have a definite claim for damages,' said the toad. 'Er... did I just say that?'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,115,[]
"Up close, he was noticeably different from the other Feegles. His hair was neater, and plaited into one pigtail. He didn't have as many tattoos. He spoke differently too, more clearly and slowly than the others, sounding his Rs like a drumroll.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,124,[]
"William nodded. 'A good question,' he said politely. 'But, ye ken, a kelda cannot wed her brrrrotherrrr. She must go to a new clan and wed a warrrrior there.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,126,"['William', 'ye ken']"
'Because the Feegles here would not know him. They'd have no rrrrespect for him.' William made 'respect' sound like an avalanche.,13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,128,['William']
"'Aye. Well... there was a time when we lived in the Queen's world and served her, before she grew so cold. But she tricked us, and we rrrrebelled. It was a dark time. She does not like us. And that is all I will say,' William added.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,132,"['Queen', 'William']"
"'They're burying her in the other part of the mound,' said William, without being asked. 'Wi' the other keldas o' this clan.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,134,"['William', 'keldas']"
"'She was their motherrr,' said William. 'They do not want to shout. Their hearts are too full for worrrrds. In time we will hold a wake to help her back to the land o' the living, and that'll be a loud one, I can promise ye. We'll dance the FiveHundredAndTwelvesome Reel to the tune o' ""The Devil Among The Lawyers"" and eat and drink, and I dare say my nephews will ha' headaches the size o' a sheep.' The old Feegle smiled briefly. 'But, for now, each Feegle remembers her in silence. We dinnae mourn like ye do, ye ken. We mourn for them that has tae stay behind.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,136,"['William', 'Feegle', 'Feegle']"
"'Nay. She was my sister. Did she no' tell ye that when a kelda goes to a new clan she takes a few o' her brothers with her? To be alone amongst strangers would be too much for a heart to bear.' The gonnagle sighed. 'Of course, in time, after the kelda weds, the clan is full of her sons and is no' so lonely for her.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,138,[]
"'You're a quick one, I'll grant ye that,' said William. 'I am the last o' those who came. When this is o'er I'll seek the leave of the next kelda to return to my ain folk in the mountains. This is a fiiine fat country and this is a fiiine bonny clan my nephews have, but I would like to die in the heather where I was borrrned. If you will excuse me, Kelda.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,140,"['William', 'bonny']"
"Tiffany suddenly wanted to go home. Perhaps it was just William's sadness, but now she felt shut up in the mound.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,142,['William']
"There was a big old clock in the farmhouse, and the time on it got set once a week. That is, when her father went to the market in Creel Springs he made a note of the position of the hands on the big clock there, and when he got home he moved the hands on their clock to the same position. It was really just for show, anyway. Everyone took their time from the sun, and the sun couldn't go wrong.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,147,[]
"Now Tiffany lay amongst the trunks of the old thorn bushes, whose leaves rustled continuously in the breeze. The mound was like a little island in the endless turf; late primroses and even a few ragged foxgloves grew up here in the shelter of the thorn roots. Her apron lay beside her where she had left it earlier.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,148,"['Tiffany', 'thorn bushes']"
"Tiffany rolled over carefully and stared up at the sky between the low branches. It'll shine out, the kelda had said...",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,151,[]
"'A' the time, mistress,' said the pictsie. Others poked their heads around the trees and out from under leaves. There were at least twenty on the mound.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,155,[]
"'Aye, mistress. 'Tis oour task to watch o'er our kelda. I'm up here most o' the time anyway, because I'm studying to become a gonnagle.' The young Feegle flourished a set of mousepipes. 'An' they willnae let me play doon there on account o' them sayin' my playin' sounds like a spider tryin' to fart through its ears, mistress.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,157,['Feegle']

"'If it's a wee call o' nature ye're talkin' aboout, mistress, the cludgie is o'er there in the chalk pit. Yell just sing oot to us where ye're goin' and no one'll go peeking, yell have oour word on it,' said the attendant Feegle.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,159,['Feegle']
"Tiffany glared at him as he stood in the primroses, beaming with pride and anxious duty. He was younger than most of them, without as many scars and lumps. Even his nose wasn't broken.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,160,[]
"'Ach, nay, mistress.' Not-as-big-as-Medium-Sized-Jock-but-bigger-than-Wee-Jock-Jock wrinkled his face. There's nay history tae the name, ye ken. But there have been a number o' brave warriors called No'-as-big-as-Medium-Sized-Jock-but-bigger-than-Wee-Jock-Jock. Why 'tis nearly as famous a name as Wee Jock itself! An', o' course, should Wee Jock hisself be taken back to the Last World then I'll get the name o' Wee Jock, which isnae to say that I mislike the name o' No'-as-big-as-Medium-Sized-Jock-but-bigger-than-Wee-Jock-Jock, ye ken. There's been many a fine story o' the exploits o' No'-as-big-as-Medium-Sized-Jock-but-bigger-than-Wee-Jock-Jock,' the pictsie added, looking so earnest that Tiffany didn't have the heart to say that they must have been very long stories.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,168,"['ye ken', 'Wee Jock', 'Wee Jock', 'ye ken']"
"Tiffany pulled Diseases of the Sheep, which was now looking very battered, out of her apron. There was a blank page at the back. She tore it out, feeling like a criminal for doing so, and took out her pencil.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,172,[]
"She was just considering this when she heard a rush of wings overhead. There was a whirring noise, a moment of silence and then a small, weary and rather muffled voice said: 'Ach, crivens.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,173,[]
"She looked out onto the turf. The body of Hamish was upside down a few feet away. His arms with their twirlers were still outstretched.[No words could describe what a Feegle in a kilt looks like upside down, so they won't try.]",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,174,['Hamish']
"It took some time to get him out. If he landed headfirst and spinning, Tiffany was told, he had to be unscrewed in the opposite direction so that his ears didn't come off.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,175,[]
"When he was upright and swaying unsteadily, Tiffany said: 'Can you wrap this letter in a stone and drop it in front of the farmhouse where people will see it?'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,176,[]
"'Then there's a sort of toy we used to make that might help you,' said Tiffany. 'You make a kind of... bag of air'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,180,['Tiffany']
"'Well, you know how things like shirts billow out on a washing line when it's windy? Well, you just make a cloth bag and tie some strings to it and a stone to the strings, and when you throw it up the bag fills with air and the stone floats down.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,182,[]
"Trilithons, they were called, which just meant 'three stones'. The only stones found naturally on the downs were flints, which were never very big. But the stones of the trilithons had been dragged from at least ten miles away, and were stacked like a child stacks toy bricks. Here and there the big stones had been stood in circles; sometimes one stone had been placed all alone. It must have taken a lot of people a long time to do all that. Some people said there'd been human sacrifices up there. Some said they were part of some old religion. Some said they marked ancient graves.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,191,[]
"Tiffany hadn't. She'd been there with her sisters a few times, as a dare, just in case there were any skulls. But the mounds around the stones were thousands of years old. All that you found there now were rabbit holes.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,193,[]
He raised his arms over his head and started to run across the turf. Tiffany jumped as the buzzard skimmed down a few yards away from her and snatched him back up into the sky.,13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,195,[]
'How can a man six inches high train a bird like that?' she asked as the buzzard circled again for height.,13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,196,[]
"'Aye, an' a big dollop o' cruelty,' Not-as-big-as-Medium-SizedJock-but-biggerthanWeeJock-Jock went on. 'Hamish trains 'em by runnin' aroound in a rabbit skin until a bird pounces on him.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,199,[]

"When her eyes got accustomed to the gloom once more she saw that the galleries were crowded with pictsies again.

"'We ought to be going if we're to follow the Queen,' she said, looking down at Rob Anybody, who'd been washing his face in a basin made of half a walnut shell. Water dripped off his beard, which he'd plaited up. There were three plaits in his long hair now, too.

"'Er... will ye no' ha' a cup o' tea?' said Rob Anybody, and a pictsie staggered forward with a big gold cup that, once, must have been made for a king.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,226,['Rob Anybody']
"Tiffany took it. She was thirsty, after all. There was a sigh from the crowd when she sipped the tea. It was actually quite good.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,227,[]
"'We stole a bag o' it fra' a pedlar who was asleep down by the high road,' said Rob Anybody. 'Good stuff, eh?' He patted down his hair with his wet hands.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,228,['Rob Anybody']
"Tiffany's cup stopped halfway to her lips. Perhaps the pictsies didn't realize how loudly they whispered, because her ear was on a level with a conversation.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,229,[]
"'Aye, fair enough, big wimmin is a' very well, but if a laddie was to try tae cuddle this one he'd had tae leave a chalk mark to show where he left off yesterday.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,232,"['tae cuddle', 'tae']"
"'She neednae have any babbies yet, then. Or mebbe not too many at a time, say. Nae more than ten, mebbe.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,234,['Nae']

"Tiffany lived on a farm. Any little beliefs that babies are delivered by storks or found under bushes tend to get sorted out early on if you live on a farm, especially when a cow is having a difficult calving in the middle of the night. And she'd helped with the lambing, when small hands could be very useful in difficult cases. She knew all about the bags of red chalk the rams had strapped to their chests, and why you knew later on that the ewes with the red smudges on their backs were going to be mothers in the spring. It's amazing what a child who is quiet and observant can learn, and this includes things people don't think she is old enough to know.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,236,[]
"'Ah, weel... it's the clan rules, ye ken,' said the Feegle, awkwardly. 'Ye being the new kelda an', an', weel, we're bound to ask ye, see, nae matter what we feel, we gotta ask ye mutter mutter mutter' He stepped back quickly.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,239,"['ye ken', 'nae']"
"'We've scrubbed up nice, ye ken,' Rob Anybody said. 'Some o' the lads actually had a bath in the dewpond, e'en though 'tis only May, and Big Yan washed under his arms for the first time ever, and Daft Wullie has picked ye a bonny bunch of flowers.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,241,"['ye ken', 'Rob Anybody', 'Big Yan', 'Daft Wullie']"
"Daft Wullie stepped forward, swollen with nervous pride, and thrust the aforesaid bouquet into the air. They probably had been nice flowers, but he didn't have much idea of what a bunch was or how you picked one. Stems and leaves and dropping petals stuck out of his fist in all directions.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,242,['Daft Wullie']
"'They want to know which one of them you're going to marry,' said Fion loudly. 'It's the rules. Ye have to choose, or quit as kelda. Ye have to choose yer man an' name the day.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,245,"['Fion', 'Ye', 'Ye']"
"Tiffany held the cup perfectly steady, but only because suddenly she couldn't move a muscle. She was thinking: Aaargh! This is not happening to me! I can't He couldn't We wouldn't They're not even This is ridiculous! Run away!",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,247,[]
"But she was aware of hundreds of nervous faces in the shadows. How you deal with this is going to be important, said her Second Thoughts. They're all watching you. And Fion wants to see what you'll do. You really didn't ought to dislike a girl four feet shorter than you, but you do.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,248,[]
"'And there's so many of you it'd be so hard to choose,' Tiffany went on, still smiling. And her Second Thoughts said: He's not happy about it either!",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,251,[]
"'I'd just like to have a little fresh air while I think about it,' said Tiffany, and didn't let the smile fade until she was out on the mound again.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,253,[]
"'Oh, right, yeah, the height thing,' said the toad. 'It might not seem much now, but when you're five feet seven he'll still be six inches high'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,263,[]
"'Well, of course, that's the point, isn't it,' said the toad. 'As far as they're concerned, there's rules. The new kelda marries the warrior of her choice and settles down and has lots and lots of Feegles. It'd be a terrible insult to refuse'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,265,[]
"'Me? Tell the kelda what to do? I wouldn't dare,' said the toad. 'And I don't like being shouted at. Even toads have their pride, you know.' It crawled back into the leaves.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,267,[]
"The old kelda must've known about this, she thought. So... she must have thought I'd be able to deal with it. It's just the rules, and they didn't know what to do about them. None of them wanted to marry a big girl like her, even if none of them would admit it. It was just the rules.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,269,[]
There must be a way round it. There had to be. But she had to accept a husband and she had to name the day. They'd told her that.,13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,270,[]
"'Then I shall.' Tiffany took a deep breath. 'At the end of the world is a great big mountain of granite rock a mile high,' she said. 'And every year, a tiny bird flies all the way to the rock and wipes its beak on it. Well, when the little bird has worn the mountain down to the size of a grain of sand... that's the day I'll marry you, Rob Anybody Feegle!'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,278,['Rob']
"'Plus there's a' that business wi' the wedding dress and buckets o' flowers and a' that kind of stuff,' said Rob Anybody, looking more cheerful by the second. 'That sort o' thing can tak' for ever, ye ken.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,284,['Rob Anybody']
"'Nae problem aboot the mountain, neither,' said Daft Wullie, still holding out the flowers. 'Just ye tell us where it is and I reckon we could ha' it doon a lot faster than any wee burdie'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,288,"['Nae', 'Daft Wullie']"
'It's got to be the bird!' yelled Rob Anybody desperately. 'OK? The wee burdie! Nae more arguin'! Anyone feelin' like arguin' will feel ma boot! Some o' us ha' got a wee laddie to steal back fra' the Quin!' He drew his sword and waved it in the air. 'Who's coming wi' me?',13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,289,"['Rob', 'Nae', 'ma', 'Quin', 'wi']"
"That seemed to work. The Nac Mac Feegle liked clear goals. Hundreds of swords and battleaxes, and one bunch of battered flowers in the case of Daft Wullie, were thrust into the air and the war cry of the Nac Mac Feegle echoed around the chamber. The period of time it takes a pictsie to go from normal to mad fighting mood is so tiny it can't be measured on the smallest clock.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,290,['Daft Wullie']
"Unfortunately, since the pictsies were very individualistic, each one had his own cry and Tiffany could only make out a few over the din:",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,291,[]
"As one Feegle, the pictsies swarmed down the galleries and across the floor and up the slope to the hole. In a few seconds the chamber was empty, except for the gonnagle and Fion.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,301,[]
"'Ach, they just go,' said Fion, shrugging. 'I'm going tae stay here and look after the fire. Someone ought to act like a proper kelda.' She glared at Tiffany.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,303,['Fion']
"'They'll run arroound for a while, mebbe stun a few bunnies and fall over a few times,' said William. They'll slow down when they find oout they don't ken what they're supposed to do yet.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,305,['William']
"'Well, I don't know much about how to get into' the toad began, trying to back away. But toads can't back up easily, and Tiffany grabbed it and put it in her apron pocket.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,313,[]
"She headed for the mounds and stones. My brother will never grow up, she thought, as she ran across the turf. That's what the old lady said. How does that work? What kind of a place is it where you never grow up?",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,314,[]
"The mounds got nearer. She saw William and Not-as-big-as-Medium-Sized-Jock-but-bigger-than-Wee-Jock-Jock running along beside her, but there was no sign of the rest of the Nac Mac Feegle.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,315,['William']
"And then she was among the mounds. Her sisters had told her that there were more dead kings buried under there, but it had never frightened her. Nothing on the downs had ever frightened her.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,316,[]
"Find a place where the time doesn't fit. Well, the mounds were history. So were the old stones. Did they fit here? Well, yes, they belonged to the past, but they'd ridden on the hills for thousands of years. They'd grown old here. They were part of the landscape.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,318,[]
"The low sun made the shadows lengthen. That was when the Chalk revealed its secrets. At some places, when the light was right, you could see the edges of old fields and tracks. The shadows showed up what brilliant noonlight couldn't see.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,319,['Chalk']
"She couldn't even see hoofprints. She wandered around the trilithons, which looked a bit like huge stone doorways, but even when she tried walking through them both ways nothing happened.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,321,[]
"A bubbling feeling in her ear suggested that someone was playing the mousepipes. She looked around, and saw William the gonnagle standing on a fallen stone. His cheeks were bulging and so was the bag of the mousepipes.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,323,['William']
"'Aye, and you coulda said ""please"",' said William. 'I'm ninety-six years old. I'm nae a dolly in yer dolly hoose. Yer granny was a fiiine wuman, but I'll no' be ordered about by a wee chit of a girl.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,331,"['William', 'dolly hoose', 'Yer']"
'I'm biggerrr on the inside!' said William. 'And I dare say your da' wouldnae be happy if a big giant of a wee girl came stampin' aroound ordering him aboout!',13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,336,['William']
"William stared at her. 'Ach, weel, yer no' doin' too badly so far,' he said, in a nicer tone of voice. 'Ye got Rob Anybody out of marryin' ye wi'oout breakin' the rules, and ye're a game lass, I'll gi' ye that. Ye'll find the way if ye tak' yer time. Just don't stamp yer foot and expect the world to do yer biddin'. All ye're doing is shoutin' for sweeties, yer ken. Use yer eyes. Use yer heid.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,340,"['William', 'Rob', ""wi'oout"", ""Ye'll"", ""ye tak'"", 'ken']"

"'You're on your own, I'm afraid,' said the toad. 'Whoever I used to be, I didn't know much about finding invisible doors. And I resent being press-ganged, too, I may say.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,343,[]
Tiffany was aware that the Nac Mac Feegle were turning up. They had a nasty habit of being really quiet when they wanted to.,13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,346,[]
"Oh, no, she thought. They think I know what to do! This isn't fair! I've not got any training for this. I haven't been to the witch school! I can't even find that! The opening must be somewhere around here and there must be dues but I don't know what they are!",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,347,[]

"'Cloggets are a trembling of the greebs in hoggets,' she read, 'which can lead to inflammation of the lower pasks. If untreated, it may lead to the more serious condition of Sloke.

"It was very small, and the kind of red you don't quite get in nature. Tiffany knew what it was. Wentworth loved the teddy-bear sweets. They tasted like glue mixed with sugar and were made of 100% Artificial Additives.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,360,['Wentworth']
"She walked forward, reading aloud about Garget of the Nostrils and the Staggers but keeping an eye on the ground. And there was another teddy-bear sweet, green this time and quite hard to see against the turf.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,363,[]
"There was one of the three-stone arches a little way away; two big stones with another one laid across the top of them. She'd walked through it before, and nothing had happened.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,365,[]
"But nothing should happen, she thought. You can't leave a doorway into your world that anyone can walk through, otherwise people would wander in and out by accident. You'd have to know it was there.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,366,[]
"She stepped through, and saw an astonishing sight: green grass, blue sky becoming pink around the setting sun, a few little white clouds late for bed, and a general warm, honey-coloured look to everything. It was amazing that there could be a sight like this. The fact that Tiffany had seen it nearly every day of her life didn't make it any less fantastic. As a bonus, you didn't even have to look through any kind of stone arch to see it. You could see it by standing practically anywhere.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,369,[]
"... something was wrong. Tiffany walked through the arch several times, and still wasn't quite sure. She held up a hand at arm's length, trying to measure the sun's height against the horizon.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,371,['Tiffany']
"The effect was... odd, and almost upsetting. It passed behind the stone and she felt her eyes move to follow the swoop... but it was late. There was a moment when the swallow should have appeared, and it didn't.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,373,[]
Then it passed across the gap and for a moment was on both sides of the other stone at the same time.,13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,374,[]
"The world seen through that gap is at least one second behind the time here,' she said, trying to sound as certain as possible. 'I thi I know this is the entrance.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,377,[]
"'Aye, it must be powerful language if you cannae make oout what the heel it's goin' on aboot!' said another pictsie.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,380,[]

"'Oh, aye,' said Rob Anybody. 'We ken that kind of stuff. We used tae live in the Quin's country, ye ken, but we rebelled against her evil rule'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,386,"['Rob Anybody', 'ken', 'Quin', 'ye ken']"
"'An' we did that, an' then she threw us oout on account o' bein' drunk an' stealin' and fightin' al' the time,' said Daft Wullie.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,387,['Daft Wullie']
"Tiffany shook her head. 'No, I didn't,' she said. 'I didn't do any real magic. I don't know how. I just looked at things and worked them out. It was cheating, really.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,391,[]
"The pictsies looked at one another. 'Ah, weel,' said Rob Anybody. 'What's magic, eh? Just wavin' a stick an' sayin' a few wee magical words. An' what's so clever aboot that, eh? But lookin' at things, really lookin' at 'em, and then workin' 'em oout, now, that's a real skill.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,392,"['weel', 'Rob Anybody']"
"'Aye, it is,' said William the gonnagle, to Tiffany's surprise. 'Ye used yer eyes and used yer heid. That's what a real hag does. The magicking is just there for advertisin'.'",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,393,['William']
"Tiffany hesitated and then thought: I can feel myself thinking. I'm watching the way I'm thinking. And what am I thinking? I'm thinking: I walked through this arch before, and nothing happened.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,396,[]
"The world I can see through the arch isn't actually real. It just looks as though it is. It's a sort of... magical picture, put there to disguise the entrance. And if you don't pay attention, well, you just walk in and out of it and you don't realize it.",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,398,[]
"She stood in front of the stones, and stretched out her hand on either side of her, and shut her eyes. Very slowly she stepped forward...",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,402,[]
"Something crunched under her boots, but she didn't open her eyes until she couldn't feel the stones any more. When she did open them...",13_The Wee Free Men,6,Chapter 7First Sight And Second Thoughts,403,[]
"'Aye, she's got First Sight, sure enough,' said William's voice behind Tiffany as she stared into the world of the Queen. 'She's seein' what's really there.'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,0,"['William', 'Tiffany', 'Queen']"
"Snow stretched away under a sky so dirty white that Tiffany might have been standing inside a ping-pong ball. Only black trunks and scribbly branches of the trees, here and there, told her where the land stopped and the sky began...",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,1,[]
"She looked down, and saw the Nac Mac Feegles pouring through the gate, waist deep in the snow. They spread out, without speaking. Some of them had drawn their swords.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,4,[]
"'Right, then,' said Rob Anybody. 'Well done. You wait here for us and we'll get your wee brother back, nae problemo'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,6,"['Rob Anybody', ""nae problemo'""]"
"Rob Anybody glanced up at the pale sky. There was no sun anywhere. 'Ye're here noo,' he said, 'so mebbe there's nae harm in tellin' ye. This is what ye call Fairyland.'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,10,"['Rob Anybody', ""Ye're"", 'Fairyland']"
"'Fairyland? No, it's not! I've seen pictures! Fairyland is... is all trees and flowers and sunshine and, and tinklyness! Dumpy little babies in romper suits with horns! People with wings! Er... and weird people! I've seen pictures!'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,11,['Fairyland']
"'It isnae always like this,' said Rob Anybody, shortly. 'An' ye cannae come wi' us because ye ha' nae weapon, mistress.'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,12,"['Rob Anybody', 'wi']"
"'OK, ye have the pan,' said Rob Anybody, 'but what ye need here is a sword of thunderbolt iron. That's like the, you know, official weapon for invadin' Fairyland.'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,15,['Rob Anybody']
"Tiffany saw a line of black dots in the distance, and felt someone climb up her back and stand on her head.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,18,[]

"William, with his eyes fixed on the approaching pack, was unscrewing some of the pipes from the mousepipes and putting them in a bag he carried hanging from his shoulder.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,22,['William']
"Slowly, William took out some much shorter, smaller pipes that had a silvery look them, and screwed them in place. He had the look of someone who wasn't going to rush.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,24,['William']
Tiffany gripped the handle of her pan. The dogs weren't barking. It would have been slightly less scary if they were.,13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,25,[]
"'I shall play,' he announced, as the dogs got close enough for Tiffany to see the drool, 'that firrrrm favourite, ""The King Underrrr Waterrrr"".'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,27,[]
"William put the mouthpiece to his lips, tapped his foot once or twice and, as a dog gathered itself to leap at Tiffany, began to play.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,29,['William']
"A lot of things happened at more or less the same time. All Tiffany's teeth started to buzz. The pan vibrated in her hands and dropped onto the snow. The dog in front of her went cross-eyed and, instead of leaping, tumbled forward.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,30,[]
"The grimhounds paid no attention to the pictsies. They howled. They spun around. They tried to bite their own tails. They stumbled, and ran into one another. The line of panting death broke into dozens of desperate animals, twisting and writhing and trying to escape from their own skins.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,31,[]
"He took the pipe from his mouth. The grimhounds, struggling in the slush, raised their heads. And then, as one dog, they put their tails between their legs and ran like greyhounds back across the snow.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,33,[]
"'He played the notes o' pain,' Rob Anybody explained. 'Ye cannae hear 'em 'cos they're pitched so high, but the doggies can. Hurts 'em in their heids. Now we'd better get movin' before she sends somethin' else.'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,36,['Rob Anybody']
"Tiffany looked at William the gonnagle. He was calmly replacing the pipes. He saw her staring at him, looked up, and winked.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,39,['William']
"No sun in the sky. Even on the dullest days, you could generally see where the sun was, but not here. And there was something else that was strange, something she couldn't quite give a name to. This didn't feel like a real place. She didn't know why she felt that, but something was wrong with the horizon. It looked close enough to touch, which was silly.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,44,[]
"And things were not... finished. Like the trees in the forest they were heading towards, for example. A tree is a tree, she thought. Close up or far away, it's a tree. It has bark and branches and roots. And you know they're there, even if the tree is so far away that it's a blob.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,45,[]
"The trees here, though, were different. She had a strong feeling that they were blobs, and were growing the roots and twigs and other details as she got closer, as if they were thinking, 'Quick, someone's coming! Look real!'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,46,[]
"It was like being in a painting where the artist hadn't bothered much with the things in the distance, but had quickly rushed a bit of realness anywhere you were looking.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,47,[]

But we said it's no' right to steal an ol' lady's only pig, or the food from them as dinnae ha' enough to eat.

"Tiffany couldn't quite pick up how she did this, but that's where things like the grimhounds and the headless horseman came from. These dreams were... more real.

"'like pipers,' said William the gonnagle. 'Fairies can't make music, ye ken. She'll steal a man awa' for the music he makes.'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,70,"['William', 'ye ken']"
"'And she takes children,' said Tiffany. 'Aye. Your wee brother's not the first,' said Rob Anybody. There's no' a lot of fun and laughter here, ye ken. She thinks she's good wi' children.'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,71,"['Tiffany', 'Rob Anybody', 'ye ken']"
"You could read the Nac Mac Feegle like a book. And it would be a big, simple book with pictures of Spot the Dog and a Big Red Ball and one or two short sentences on each page. What they were thinking turned up right there on their faces and, now, they were all wearing a look that said: Crivens, I hope she disnae ask us the question we dinnae wantae answer...",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,73,"['Crivens', 'dinnae wantae']"
"'Oh, aye,' said Rob Anybody, slowly. 'She didnae lie to ye there. The Quin'll try to be kind to him, but she disnae know how. She's an elf. They're no' very good at thinking of other people.'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,75,"['Rob Anybody', 'didnae']"
"'I darrresay she'll send him back, in due time,' said William. 'An' he willnae be any olderr. Nothing grows old here. Nothing grows. Nothing at all.'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,79,['William']
Rob Anybody made a noise in his throat. It sounded like a voice that was trying to say 'aye' but was being argued with by a brain that knew the answer was 'no'.,13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,81,['Rob']
"Daft Wullie was the first to speak. That's a lot o' stuff,' he said. 'For example, the meltin' point o' lead is'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,83,['Daft Wullie']
"""Time passes slower the deeper you go intae this place,' said Rob Anybody quickly. 'Years pass like days. The Quin'll get tired o' the wee lad after a coupla months, mebbe. A coupla months here, ye ken, where the time is slow an' heavy. But when he comes back into the mortal world, you'll be an old lady, or mebbe you'll be deid. So if youse has bairns o' yer own, you'd better tell them to watch out for a wee sticky kid wanderin' the hills shoutin' for sweeties, 'cos that'll be their Uncle Wentworth. That wouldna be the worst o' it, neither. Live in dreams for too long and ye go mad, ye can never wake up prop'ly, ye can never get the hang o' reality again.'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,84,"['Rob Anybody', 'ye ken', ""bairns o'""]"
"'We doon't doubt it,' said Rob Anybody. 'An' wheree'er ye go, we'll come with ye. The Nac Mac Feegle are afeared o' nothing!'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,88,['Rob Anybody']
"All the Nac Mac Feegles were creeping along behind her. Rob Anybody gave her a cheery nod. And all her footprints had become holes in the snow, with grass showing through.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,94,['Rob']
"The trees began to annoy her. The way things changed was more frightening than any monster. You could hit a monster, but you couldn't hit a forest. And she wanted to hit something.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,95,[]
"She stopped and scraped some snow away from the base of a tree and, just for a moment, there was nothing but greyness where it had been. As she watched, the bark grew down to where the snow was. Then it just stayed there, pretending it had been there all the time.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,96,[]
"She was second thinking again. She felt the fear grow, she felt her stomach become a red-hot lump, she felt her elbows begin to sweat. But it was... not connected. Shewatched herself being frightened, and that meant that there was still this part of herself, the watching part, that wasn't.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,98,[]
"And that was where it went wrong. Fear gripped her, all at once. She was in a strange world, with monsters, being followed by hundreds of little blue thieves. And... Black dogs. Headless horsemen. Monsters in the river. Sheep whizzing backwards across fields. Voices under the bed...",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,100,[]
"The terror took her. But, because she was Tiffany, she ran towards it, raising the pan. She had to get through the forest, find the Queen, get her brother, leave this place!",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,101,['Queen']
"There was no snow, but therewas the whiteness of the bedsheet and the plaster ceiling of her bedroom. She stared at it for a while, then leaned down and peered under the bed.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,104,[]
"There was nothing there but the guzunder. When she flung open the door of the doll's house, there was no one inside but the two toy soldiers and the teddy bear and the headless dolly.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,105,[]
"The walls were solid. The floor creaked like it always did. Her slippers were the same as they always were: old, comfortable and with all the pink fluff worn off.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,106,[]
"The door squeaked open and the cat Ratbag came in. He rubbed up against her legs, purring like a distant thunderstorm, and then went and curled up on her bed.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,109,['Ratbag']
"Tiffany darted out through the scullery and into the dairy. She scrambled on hands and knees around the floor, peering under the sink and behind cupboards.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,112,[]
"No one came. She was alone in the room. She'd often been alone in the room, and had enjoyed it. It was almost her private territory. But now, somehow, it was too empty, too clean...",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,114,[]
"When she wandered back into the kitchen her mother was still standing by the sink, washing dishes, but a plate of steaming porridge had been put down in the one set place on the table.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,115,[]
"'I'll make some more butter today,' said Tiffany carefully, sitting down. 'I might as well while we're getting all this milk.'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,116,['Tiffany']
"Tiffany sighed. 'And then she woke up and it was all a dream.' It was just about the worst ending you could have to any story. But it had all seemed soreal. She could remember the smoky smell in the pictsies' cave, and the way... who was it?... oh, yes, he'd been called Rob Anybody... the way Rob Anybody had always been so nervous about talking to her.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,120,"['Rob', 'Rob Anybody']"
"It was strange, she thought, that Ratbag had rubbed up against her. He'd sleep on her bed if he could get away with it, but during the day he kept well out of Tiffany's way. How odd...",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,121,['Ratbag']
"There was a rattling noise near the mantelpiece. The china shepherdess on Granny's shelf was moving sideways of its own accord and, as Tiffany watched with her porridge spoon halfway to her mouth, it slid off and smashed on the floor.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,122,['Granny']
The rattling went on. Now it was coming from the big oven. She should see the door actually shaking on the hinges.,13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,123,[]
"She turned to her mother, and saw her put another plate down by the sink. But it wasn't being held in a hand...",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,124,[]
"The walls were shifting. The floor moved. And now the thing turning round at the sink was not even human but just... stuff, no more human than a gingerbread man, grey as old dough, changing shape as it lumbered towards Tiffany.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,128,[]
"The scream came from somewhere deep inside. There was no Second Thought, no first thought, just a scream. It seemed to spread out as it left Tiffany's mouth until it became a black tunnel in front of her, and as she fell into it she heard, in the commotion behind her:",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,131,[]
"She was lying on damp ground in the snowy, gloomy wood. Pictsies were watching her carefully but, she saw, there were others behind them staring outwards, into the gloom amongst the tree trunks.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,134,[]
"'But that... thing was in it, and then you all came out of the oven!' she said. 'You were in my dream! What iswas that creature?'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,140,[]
"'That was what we call a drome,' he said. 'Nothing here really belongs here, remember? Everything is a reflection from outside, or something kidnapped from another worrrld, or mebbe something the Quin has made outa magic. It was hidin' in the trees, and ye was goin' so fast ye didnae see it. Ye ken spiders?'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,142,"['Quin', 'Ye ken']"
"'Well, spiders spin webs. Dromes spin dreams. It's easy in this place. The world you come from is nearly real. This place is nearly unreal, so it's almost a dream anywa'. And the drome makes a dream for ye, wi' a trap in it. If ye eats anythin' in the dream, ye'll never wanta' leave it.'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,144,['wi']
"'It likes watchin' dreams. It has fun watching ye ha' fun. An' it'll watch ye eatin' dream food, until ye starve to death. Then the drome'll eat ye. Not right away, o' course. It'll wait until ye've gone a wee bit runny, because it hasnae teeth.'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,147,[]
"'The best way is to find the drome,' said Rob Anybody. 'It'll be in the dream with you, in disguise. Then ye just gives it a good kickin'.'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,149,['Rob Anybody']
"'Aye. Ye could say it's the bit the tourists dinnae see,' said William. 'An' ye did well. Ye were fightin' it. Ye knew it wasnae right.'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,153,"['William', 'Ye', 'Ye']"
"Tiffany remembered the friendly cat, and the falling shepherdess. She'd been trying to send messages to herself. She should have listened.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,154,[]
"'Ach, we can generally find a way intae anywhere, even a dream,' said William, smiling. 'We're a stealin' folk, after all.' A piece of the drome fell out of the tree and flopped onto the snow.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,156,['William']
"'Aye. I believe you. Ye have murrrder in yer eyes,' said William, with a touch of admiration. 'If I was a drome I'd be pretty fearful noo, if I had a brain. There'll be more of them, mark you, and some of 'em are cunning. The Quin uses 'em as guards.'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,158,"['Ye', 'William', 'Quin']"
"'I won't be fooled!' Tiffany remembered the horror of the moment when the thing had lumbered around changing shape. It was worse because it was in her house, her place. She'd felt real terror as the big shapeless thing crashed across the kitchen, but the anger had been there too. It was invading her place.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,159,[]
"And Tiffany couldn't stop her thoughts. I don't love him. I know I don't. He's just so... sticky, and can't keep up, and I have to spend too much time looking after him, and he's always screaming for things. I can't talk to him. He just wants all the time.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,163,[]
"She'd been brought up not to be selfish. She knew she wasn't, not in the way people meant. She tried to think of other people. She never took the last slice of bread. This was a different feeling.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,165,[]
"She wasn't being brave or noble or kind. She was doing this because it had to be done, because there was no way that she could not do it. She thought of:",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,166,[]
"... Granny Aching's light, weaving slowly across the downs, on freezing, sparkly nights or in storms like a raging war, saving lambs from the creeping frost or rams from the precipice. She froze and struggled and tramped through the night for idiot sheep that never said thank you and would probably be just as stupid tomorrow, and get into the same trouble again. And she did it because not doing it was unthinkable.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,167,"[""Granny Aching's""]"
There had been the time when they met the pedlar and the donkey in the lane. It was a small donkey and could hardly be seen under the pack he'd piled on it. And he was thrashing it because it had fallen over.,13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,168,[]
"The pedlar had stopped when he heard the growling. The sheepdogs had taken up position on either side of the man, so that he couldn't quite see them both at once. He raised his stick as if to hit Lightning, and Thunder's growl grew louder.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,170,[]
"'Now throw down the stick,' said Granny. The man did so, dropping it into the dust as though it had suddenly grown red-hot.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,173,['Granny']
"Suddenly, so fast that her hand was a blur, Granny sliced it across the man's face twice, leaving two long red marks. He began to move and some desperate thought must have saved him, because now the dogs were almost frantic for the command to leap.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,175,['Granny']
"'Hurts, don't it,' said Granny, pleasantly. 'Now, I knows who you are, and I reckon you knows who I am. You sell pots and pans and they ain't bad, as I recall But if I put out the word you'll have no business in my hills. Be told. Better to feed your beast than whip it. You hear me?'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,176,['Granny']
"'That'll do,' said Granny Aching, and instantly the dogs became, once more, two ordinary sheepdogs, who came and sat either side of her with their tongues hanging out.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,178,['Granny Aching']
"Tiffany watched the man unpack some of the load and strap it to his own back and then, with great care, urge the donkey on along the road. Granny watched him go while filling her pipe with Jolly Sailor. Then, as she lit it, she said, as if the thought had just occurred to her:",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,179,['Granny']
"'Them as can do, has to do for them as can't. And someone has to speak up for them as has no voices.'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,180,[]

"'I'll walk!' The memory of the huge dead face of the drome was trying to come back into her mind, but fury gave it no space. 'Where's the frying pan? Thank you! Let's go!'",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,186,[]
"She set off through the strange trees. The hoof-prints almost glowed in the gloom. Here and there other tracks crossed them, tracks that could have been birds' feet, rough round footprints that could have been made by anything, squiggly lines that a snake might make, if there were such things as snow snakes.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,187,[]
"Even with the edge of the fury dying away, it was hard looking at things here without her head aching. Things that seemed far off got closer too quickly, trees changed shape as she passed them...",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,189,[]
"Almost unreal, William had said. Nearly a dream. The world didn't have enough reality in it for distances and shapes to work probably. Once again the magic artist was painting madly. If she looked hard at a tree it changed, and became more tree-like and less like something drawn by Wentworth with his eyes shut.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,190,"['William', 'Wentworth']"
"This is a made-up world, Tiffany thought. Almost like a story. The trees don't have to be very detailed because who looks at trees in a story?",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,191,['Tiffany']
"She stopped in a small clearing, and stared hard at a tree. It seemed to know it was being watched. It became more real. The bark roughened, and proper twigs grew on the end of the branches.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,192,[]
"The snow was melting around her feet, too. Although 'melting' was the wrong word. It was just disappearing, leaving leaves and grass.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,193,[]
"If I was a world that didn't have enough reality to go around, Tiffany thought, then snow would be quite handy. It doesn't take a lot of effort. It's just white stuff. Everything looks white and simple. But I can make it complicated. I'm more real than this place.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,194,['Tiffany']
"And suddenly the air was filling with small people, smaller than a Feegle, with wings like dragonflies. There was a golden glow around them. Tiffany, entranced, reached out a hand",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,196,[]
At the same moment what felt like the entire clan of Nac Mac Feegle landed on her back and sent her sliding into a snowdrift.,13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,197,[]
"When she struggled out, the clearing was a battlefield. The pictsies were jumping and slashing at the flying creatures which were buzzing around them like wasps. As she stared two of them dived onto Rob Anybody and lifted him off his feet by his hair.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,198,['Rob']
"He rose in the air, yelling and struggling. Tiffany leaped up and grabbed him around the waist, flailing at the creatures with her other hand. They let go of the pictsie and dodged easily, zipping through the air as fast as hummingbirds. One of them bit her on the finger before buzzing away.",13_The Wee Free Men,7,Chapter 8Land Of Winter,199,[]
"It sounded like some animal in terrible pain. But it was, in fact, Not-as-big-as-Medium-Sized-Jock-but-bigger-than-Wee-Jock-Jock, who was standing on a snowdrift with one hand pressed to his heart and the other outstretched, very theatrically.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,2,[]
"'Ach, the muse is a terrible thing to have happen to ye,' said Rob Anybody, putting his hands over his ears.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,5,['Rob Anybody']
"'... oooooiiiiiit is with grreat lamentation and much worrying dismay,' the pictsie groaned, 'that we rrregard the doleful prospect of Fairyland in considerrrable decay...'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,6,[]
"'With quite a large number of drrrrrrreadful incidents happening everrry day,' Not-as-big-as-Medium-Sized-Jock-but-bigger-than-Wee-Jock-Jock recited. 'Including, I am sorrrry to say, an aerial attack by the otherwise quite attractive fey...'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,8,[]
Feegles were picking themselves up off the ground. Some were bleeding' where the fairies had bitten them. Several were lying curled up and groaning.,13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,12,[]
"'It isnae too bad,' Rob Anybody shouted up from below. 'No one taken by them, just a few cases where the lads didnae put their hands o'er their ears in time.'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,14,['Rob']
"'That, lad,' he said proudly, 'was some of the worst poetry I have heard for a long time. It was offensive to the ear and a torrrture to the soul. The last couple of lines need some work but ye has the groanin' off fiiine. A' in a', a verrry commendable effort! We'll make a gonnagle out of ye' yet!'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,18,[]
"The pictsies assembled into battle order again, although it was pretty disorderly, and set off. Tiffany didn't rush too far ahead this time.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,21,[]
"'Ah, but it wasnae so bad then. It wasnae perfect, mark you, but the Quin wasnae as cold in them days. The King was still aroound. She was always happy then.'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,28,['Quin']
"'A bit, mebbe,' said Rob. 'But they was magical words. Forests destroyed, mountains explodin', a few hundred deaths, that kind of thing. And he went off to his own world. Fairyland was never a picnic, ye ken, even in the old days. But it was fine if you kept alert, an' there was flowers and burdies and summertime. Now there's the dromes and the hounds and the stinging fey and such stuff creepin' in from their own worlds, and the whole place has gone doon the lavvy.'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,32,"['Rob', 'ye ken', 'fey']"
"Things taken from their own worlds, thought Tiffany, as she tramped through the snow. Worlds all squashed together like peas in a sack, or hidden inside one another like bubbles inside other bubbles.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,33,[]
"She had a picture in her head of things creeping out of their own world and into another, in the same way that mice invaded the larder. Only, there were worse things than mice.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,34,[]
"What would a drome do if it got into our world? You'd never know it was there. It'd sit in the corner and you'd never see it, because it wouldn't let you. And it'd change the way you saw the world, give you nightmares, make you want to die...",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,35,[]
"And I'm in Fairyland, where dreams can hurt. Somewhere all stories are real, all songs are true. I thought that was a strange thing for the kelda to say...",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,37,[]
"And Tiffany thought: No, that was a Third Thought. I'm thinking about how I think about what I'm thinking. At least, I think so.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,39,['Tiffany']
"The forest went on. Or perhaps it was a small forest and, somehow, moved around them as they walked. This was Fairyland, after all. You couldn't trust it.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,41,[]
"And the snow still vanished where Tiffany walked, and she only had to look at a tree for it to smarten up and make an effort to look like a real tree.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,42,['Tiffany']
"The Queen is... well, a queen, Tiffany thought. She's got a world of her own. She could do anything with it. And all she does is steal things, mess up people's lives...",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,43,"['Queen', 'Tiffany']"
"'She might still have him!' said Tiffany, gripping the pan handle nervously and staring at the blue shadows between the trees.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,48,[]
"A stag appeared through the trees, steam pouring off it. It stared at Tiffany with wild red eyes and then, bunching up, leaped over her. She smelled the stink of it as she ducked, she felt its sweat on her neck.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,51,[]
"The first one she caught with the edge of the pan, bowling it over. The other turned to snap at her, then looked down in amazement as pictsies erupted from the snow under each paw. It was hard to bite anyone when all four of your feet were moving away in different directions, and then other pictsies landed on its head and biting anything ever again soon became... impossible. The Nac Mac Feegle hated grimhounds.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,54,[]
"Tiffany looked up at a white horse. That was real, too, as far as she could tell. And there was a boy on it.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,55,[]
"'Who are you?' said Tiffany, pushing her hair out of her eyes. It was the best she could do right now.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,57,[]
"Tiffany peered at him. The dull, second-hand light of Fairyland was not very good, but the more she looked, the more certain she was. 'Your name is Roland, isn't it?' she said.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,59,['Roland']
"'I demand that you stop talking!' The boy's expression was strange now, creased up and pink, as if he was trying not to cry. He raised his hand with a riding whip in it",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,62,[]
"There was a very faint 'thwap'. Tiffany glanced down. The Nac Mac Feegles had formed a pile under the horse's belly and one of them, climbing up on their shoulders, had just cut through the saddle girth.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,63,[]
"She held up a hand quickly. 'Stand still!' she shouted, trying to sound commanding. 'If you move you'll fall off your horse!'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,64,[]
'Is that a spell? Are you a witch?' The boy dropped the whip and pulled a long dagger from his belt. 'Death to witches!',13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,65,[]
"He urged the horse forward with a jerk and then there was one of those long moments, a moment when the whole universe said 'uh-oh', and, still holding the dagger, the boy swivelled around the horse and landed in the snow.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,66,[]
"'I do know you,' she said. 'Your name is Roland. You're the Baron's son. They said you'd died in the forest'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,71,"['Roland', 'Baron']"
"But the boy had got to his feet and was running back through the forest. He turned and shouted, 'Get away from me!'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,76,[]
"Tiffany ran after him, jumping over snow-covered logs, and saw him ahead, dodging from tree to tree. Then he paused, and looked back.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,77,[]
"Her feet moved under her, perfectly. They twirled her around, and this time her hand was caught by a peacock, or at least someone with the head of a peacock. She glanced over his shoulder and saw that she was now in a room, no, a ballroom full of masked people, dancing.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,81,[]
"The music was strange. There was a kind of rhythm to it, but it sounded muffled and odd, as if it was being played backwards, underwater, by musicians who'd never seen their instruments before.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,83,[]
"And she hoped the dancers were wearing masks. She realized she was looking through the eyeholes of one, and wondered what she was. She was also wearing a long dress, which glittered.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,84,[]
"O-K, she thought carefully. There was a drome there, and I didn't stop to look. And now I'm in a dream. But it's not mine. It must make use of what it finds in your head, and I've never been to anything like this...",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,85,[]
"'Fwa waa fwah waa wha?' said the peacock. The voice was like the music. It sounded almost like a voice, but it wasn't.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,86,[]
"Somewhere in here is the drome, said Tiffany to herself. And it must be a pretty good one. This is a big dream.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,91,['Tiffany']
"Little things were wrong, though. There were hundreds of people in the room, but the ones in the distance, although they were moving about in quite a natural way, seemed the same as the treesblobs and swirls of colour. You had to look hard to notice this, though.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,92,[]
"People in brilliant costumes and still more masks walked arm in arm past her, as if she were just another guest. Those that weren't joining the new dance were heading for the long tables at one side of the hall, which were piled with food.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,94,[]
"Tiffany had only seen such food in pictures. People didn't starve on the farm, but even when food was plentiful, at Hogswatch or after harvest, it never looked like this. The farm food was mostly shades of white or brown. It was never pink and blue, and never wobbled.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,95,[]
"There were things on sticks, and things that gleamed and glistened in bowls. Nothing was simple. Everything had cream on it, or chocolate whirls, or thousands of little coloured balls. Everything was spun or glazed or added to or mixed up. This wasn't food; it was what food became if it had been good and had gone to food heaven.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,96,[]
"It wasn't just for eating, it was for show. It was piled up against mounds of greenery and enormous arrangements of flowers. Here and there huge transparent carvings were landmarks in this landscape of food. Tiffany reached up and touched a glittering cockerel. It was ice, damp under her fingertips. There were others, too... a jolly fat man, a bowl of fruits all carved in ice, a swan...",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,97,[]
"Tiffany was, for a moment, tempted. It seemed a very long time since she had eaten anything. But the food was too obviously not food at all. It was bait. It was supposed to say: Hello, little kiddie. Eat me.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,98,[]
"She'd seen pictures of lots of different cheeses in the Almanack. She was good at cheese and had always wondered what the others tasted like. They were faraway cheeses with strange sounding names, cheeses like Treble Wibbley, Waney Tastey, Old Argg, Red Runny and the legendary Lancre Blue, which had to be nailed to the table to stop it attacking other cheeses.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,101,['Treble Wibbley']
"Just a taste wouldn't hurt, surely. It wasn't the same as eating, was it? After all, she was in control, wasn't she? She'd seen right through the dream straight away, hadn't she? So it couldn't have any effect, could it?",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,102,[]
"Now it was a shepherdess, with a saddlebag dress and a big bonnet. Tiffany was sure it had been a swan when she'd looked at it before.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,107,[]
"The anger came back. She'd nearly been fooled! She looked at the cheese knife. 'Be a sword,' she said. After all, the drome was making her dream, but she was doing the dreaming. She was real. Part of her wasn't asleep.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,108,[]
"'Ach, weel, it's a cunnin' ol' drome ye're dealin' with here,' said Rob Anybody. 'The dream wouldnae let us in unless we wuz properly dressed...'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,114,['Rob Anybody']
"He stepped out, looking very sheepish in a black suit with a bow tie. There was more rustling and other pictsies pushed their way out of the greenery. They looked a bit like red-headed penguins.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,115,[]
"'Aye,' said Daft Wullie, who had a piece of lettuce on his head. 'An' these troosers are a wee bit chafin' around the nethers, I don't mind tellin' ye.'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,117,['Daft Wullie']
"'We'll help ye look,' said Rob Anybody. 'The thing cannae hide if ye're right up close. Be careful, mind you! If it thinks ye're gonna whap it one, there's nae tellin' what it'll try! Spread oot, lads, and pretend ye're enjoying the cailey.'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,120,"['Rob Anybody', ""nae tellin'""]"
"'Crivens, ye wouldna' believe it,' said Rob Anybody, rolling his eyes. 'Nae, ye pudden'! This is a posh party, ye ken? That means ye mak' small talk an' mingle!'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,122,"['Crivens', 'Rob Anybody', 'Nae', 'ye ken']"
"Even in a dream, even at a posh ball, the Nac Mac Feegle knew how to behave. You charged in madly, and you screamed... politely.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,124,[]
"There was something wrong with the crowd. No one was panicking or trying to run away, which was certainly the right response to an invasion of Feegles.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,129,[]
"Tiffany set off again through the crowd. The masked people at the party paid her no attention, either. And that's because they're background people, she thought, just like the background trees. She walked along the room to a pair of double doors, and pulled them open.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,130,[]
"So... the only way out was to find the drome. She hadn't really expected anything else. It could be anywhere. It could be behind a mask, it could be a table. It could be anything.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,132,[]
"He was sitting at a table by himself. It was spread with food, and he had a spoon in his hand.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,134,[]
"She ran over and knocked it onto the floor. 'Haven't you got any sense at all?' she said, pulling him upright. 'Do you want to stay here for ever?'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,135,[]
"And then she felt the movement behind her. Later on, she was sure she hadn't heard anything. She'd just known. It was a dream, after all.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,136,[]
"Tiffany turned back to the drome. It was moving towards her, but very slowly, trying to stay in the shadows. It looked like a little snowman made of dirty snow.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,141,[]
"The music was getting louder. The candles were getting brighter. Out on the huge dance floor, the animal-headed couples whirled faster and faster. And the floor shook. The dream was in trouble.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,142,[]
"The Nac Mac Feegles were running to her from every part of the floor, trying to be heard above the din.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,143,[]
"In front of Tiffany, the drome fell backwards. She was holding the old frying pan in her hand, but it had cut beautifully. Odd things, dreams.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,148,[]
"She turned and faced Roland, who was staring at her with a face so pale he might as well have been a drome.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,149,['Roland']
"'It was frightened,' she said. 'It wanted me to attack you instead. It tried to look like you and made you look like a drome. But it didn't know how to speak. You do.'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,150,[]
"'Please don't be so... so stupid,' said Tiffany. 'I'm going to find the Queen and get my brother back, whatever you say. Understand? I've got this far. And I've got help, you know.'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,160,"['Tiffany', 'Queen']"
"'It's more complicated than that,' said the boy. 'You don't know what it's like here. There's dreams inside dreams. There's... other things that live inside dreams, horrible things. You never know if you've really woken up. And the Queen controls them all. They're fairy people, anyway. You can't trust them. You can't trust anyone. I don't trust you. You're probably just another dream.'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,168,['Queen']
"Tiffany hesitated. The only other real person was going away, leaving her here with nothing but the trees, and the shadows.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,170,[]
"Well, of course she'd fought things and won, hadn't she? But the Nac Mac Feegles had been there and, somehow, that'd made it easy. They never gave up, they'd attack absolutely anything and they didn't know the meaning of the word 'fear'.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,174,[]
"Tiffany, who had read her way through the dictionary, had a Second Thought there. Tear' was only one of thousands of words the pictsies probably didn't know the meaning of. Unfortunately, she did know what it meant. And the taste and feel of fear, too. She felt it now.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,175,[]
"The cold blue shadows between the trees seemed to be spreading out. They were darkest ahead of her, where the hoofprints led. Strangely enough the wood behind her seemed almost light and inviting.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,177,[]
"Someone doesn't want me to go on, she thought. That was... quite encouraging. But the twilight was misty and shimmered unpleasantly. Anything could be waiting.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,178,[]
"She was waiting, too. She realized that she was waiting for the Nac Mac Feegles, hoping against hope that she'd hear a sudden cry, even of 'Crivens!' (She was sure it was a swear word.)",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,179,['Crivens']
"I'm stuck in a wood of evil dreams and I'm all alone and I think it's getting darker,' said Tiffany. 'What should I do?'",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,182,['Tiffany']
"She pulled it out and opened it at random. There was a cure for the Steams, but it had been crossed out in pencil. Written in the margin, in Granny Aching's big, round,careful handwriting was:",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,187,"[""Granny Aching's""]"
"Tiffany closed the book with care, and put it back gently so as not to disturb the sleeping toad. Then, gripping the pan's handle tightly, she stepped into the long blue shadows.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,188,[]
"How do you get shadows when there's no sun in the sky? she thought, because it was better to think about things like this than all the other, much worse things that were on her mind.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,189,[]
"But these shadows didn't need light to create them. They crawled around on the snow of their own accord, and backed away when she walked towards them. That, at least, was a relief.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,190,[]
"They piled up behind her. They were following her. She turned and stamped her foot a few times and they scurried off behind the trees, but she knew they were flowing back when she wasn't looking.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,191,[]
"She saw a drome in the distance ahead of her, standing half-hidden behind a tree. She screamed at it and waved the pan threateningly, and it lumbered off quickly.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,192,[]
"The track led uphill a little, into what looked like a much thicker mist. It glowed faintly. She headed for it. There was no other way to go.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,194,[]
"There were four dromes in itbig ones, bigger than any she'd seen so far. They were sitting down in a square, their dumpy legs stretched out in front of them. Each one had a gold collar around its neck, attached to a chain.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,196,[]
... who could put a collar around the neck of a drome? Only someone who could dream as well as they could.,13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,198,[]
"In the centre of the square formed by the dromes the air was full of mist. The hooftracks, and the tracks of Roland, led down past the tame dromes and into the cloud.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,200,['Roland']
"There was nothing else nearby. No birds sang, nothing moved in the woods. But she could make out three more dromes now, their big round soggy faces peering at her around tree trunks.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,202,[]
At a time like this it would be nice to have someone around to say something like 'No! It's too dangerous! Don't do it!',13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,204,[]
"Unfortunately, there wasn't. She was going to commit an act of extreme bravery and no one would know if it all went wrong. That was frightening, but also... annoying. That was it...annoying. This place annoyed her. It was all stupid and strange.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,205,[]
"It was the same feeling she'd had when Jenny had leaped out of the river. Out ofher river. And the Queen had taken her brother. Maybe it was selfish to think like that, but anger was better than fear. Fear was a damp cold mess, but anger had an edge. She could use it.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,206,"['Jenny', 'Queen']"
"Raising the pan to shoulder height, to swipe at anything that came near, and suppressing a dreadful urge to go to the toilet, Tiffany walked slowly down the slope, across the snow, through the mist.... and into summer.",13_The Wee Free Men,8,Chapter 9Lost Boys,212,['Tiffany']
"She'd had sunstroke once, up on the downs, when she'd gone without a bonnet. And this was like that; the world around her was in worrying shades of dull green, yellow and purple, without shadows. The air was so full of heat that she felt she could squeeze smoke out of it.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,1,[]
"They were daisies. She knew it. She'd stared at them dozens of times, in that strange picture in the Faerie Tales. They were daisies, and these weren't giant reeds around her, they were blades of grass and she was very, very small.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,6,[]
"She was in the weird picture. The picture was the dream, or the dream was the picture. Which way round didn't matter, because she was right in the middle of it. If you fell off a cliff, it wouldn't matter if the ground was rushing up or you were rushing down. You were in trouble either way.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,7,[]
"Somewhere in the distance there was a loud crack! and a ragged cheer. Someone clapped and said, in a sleepy sort of voice, 'Well done. Good man. Ver' well done...'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,8,[]
"On a flat rock, a man was cracking nuts half as big as he was, with a two-handed hammer. He was being watched by a crowd of people. Tiffany used the word 'people' because she couldn't think of anything else that was suitable, but it was stretching the word a bit to make it fit all the... people.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,10,[]
"They were different sizes, for one thing. Some of the men were taller than her, even if you allowed for the fact that everyone was shorter than the grass. But others were tiny. Some of them had faces that you wouldn't look at twice. Others had faces that no one would want to look at even once.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,11,[]
"This is a dream, after all, Tiffany told herself. It doesn't have to make sense, or be nice. It's a dream, not a daydream. People who say things like 'may all your dreams come true' should try living in one for five minutes.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,12,['Tiffany']
"She stepped out into the bright, stiflingly hot clearing just as the man raised his hammer again, and said, 'Excuse me?'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,13,[]
"'Thank you,' she said, and because she had been brought up to be polite she added, 'Best of luck with the nut-cracking.'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,21,[]
"Tiffany walked off, trying to look as if this collection of strange nearly-people was just another crowd. Probably the scariest ones were the Big Women, two of them.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,23,[]
Big women were valued on the Chalk. Farmers liked big wives. Farm work was hard and there was no call for a wife who couldn't carry a couple of piglets or a bale of hay. But these two could have carried a horse each. They stared haughtily at her as she walked past.,13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,24,[]
"'Nice day for watching nuts being cracked!' said Tiffany cheerfully, as she went past. Their huge pale faces wrinkled, as if they were trying to work out what she was.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,26,[]
"Sitting down near them, watching the nut-cracker with an expression of concern, was a little man with a large head, a fringe of white beard and pointy ears. He was wearing very old-fashioned clothes, and his eyes followed Tiffany as she went past.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,27,['Tiffany']
"There were lords and ladies, people in fine clothes and even a few shepherds. But some of them had a pieced-together look. They looked, in fact, like a picture book back in her bedroom.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,33,[]
"It was made of thick card, worn raggedy-edged by generations of Aching children. Each page showed a character, and each was cut into four strips that could be turned over independently. The point of the whole thing was that a bored child could turn over parts of the pages and change the way the characters were dressed. You could end up with a soldier's head on a baker's chest wearing a maid's dress and a farmer's big boots.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,34,['baker']
Tiffany had never been bored enough. She considered that even things that spend their whole lives hanging from the underside of branches would never be bored enough to spend more than five seconds with that book.,13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,35,[]
"The people around her looked either as though they'd been taken from that book, or had dressed for a fancy-dress party in the dark. One of two of them nodded to her as she passed, but didn't seem surprised to see her.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,36,[]
"'Yes,' she said, edging away, and feeling that only a sister has a right to call even a brother like Wentworth 'horrible'.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,53,['Wentworth']
"'Look, I didn't know what you were, all right?' said Roland. 'There's always weird things in the forest. Lost people, bits of dreams that're still lying around... you have to be careful. But if you really know the way, then I ought to get back before my father worries too much.'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,69,['Roland']
"'Well, the light doesn't really change much,' said the boy. 'It feels like I've been here... oh, hours. Maybe a day...'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,72,[]
"'Because in a way it... feels like... longer. I've only been hungry two or three times, and been to the... you know... twice, so it can't be very long. But I've done all kinds of things... it's been a busy day...' His voice trailed off.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,76,[]
"Hmm, thought Tiffany. 'I don't think that's going to happen,' she said aloud. 'Your father has been very miserable. Besides, it's not your fault you were stolen by the Queen' She hesitated, because this time it was his expression that gave it all away. 'Was it?'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,83,['Tiffany']
"'Well, there was this fine lady on a horse with bells all over its harness and she galloped past me when I was out hunting and she was laughing, so of course I spurred my horse and chased after her and...' He fell silent.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,84,[]
"'It's not...bad here,' said Roland. 'It just keeps... changing. There's... doorways everywhere. I mean entrances into other... places...' His voice tailed off.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,86,['Roland']
"'And then she told me to sing and dance and skip and play,' said Roland. 'She said that's what children were supposed to do.'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,94,['Roland']
"'Would you? I'd feel like an idiot. I'm twelve, you know.' Roland hesitated. 'In fact, if what you say is true, I'm thirteen now, right?'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,96,['Roland']
"'Why did she want you to skip and play?' said Tiffany, instead of saying, 'No, you're still twelve and act like you're eight.'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,97,[]
"Tiffany wondered about this. As far as she could see, children mostly argued, shouted, ran around very fast, laughed loudly, picked their noses, got dirty and sulked. Any seen dancing and skipping and singing had probably been stung by a wasp.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,99,[]
"'Sugar plums,' said Roland. 'They're, like, plums. You know? With sugar on? She's always trying to feed me sugar! She thinks I like it!'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,103,['Roland']
"A small bell rang in Tiffany's memory. 'You don't think she's trying to feed you up before she bakes you in an oven and eats you, do you?'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,104,[]
"'No, I know how to hunt! Real animals get in here. I don't know how. Sneebs thinks they find the doorways in by accident. And then they starve to death, because it's always winter here. Sometimes the Queen sends out robbing parties if a door opens into an interesting world, too. This whole place is like... a pirate ship.'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,107,"['Sneebs', 'Queen']"
"'Yuck. I suppose that's the kind of thing peasants have to know about,' said Roland. 'I'm glad I don't. I've seen through the doorways to one or two worlds. They wouldn't let me out, though. We got potatoes from one, and fish from another. I think they frighten people into giving them stuff. Oh, and there was the world where the dromes come from. They laughed about that and said if I wanted to go in there I was welcome. I didn't! It's all red, like a sunset. A great huge sun on the horizon, and a red sea that hardly moves, and red rocks, and long shadows. And those horrible creatures sitting on the rocks, living off crabs and spidery things and little scribbity creatures. It was awful. There was this sort of ring of little claws and shells and bones around every one of them.'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,111,"['Yuck', 'Roland']"
"'Those? Most of them aren't even real,' said Roland. 'I mean the elves. The fairies. That's who she's Queen of. Didn't you know?'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,115,['Roland']
"'I think they can be any size they like,' said Roland. They're not... exactly real. They're like... dreams of themselves. They can be as thin as air or solid as a rock. Sneebs says.'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,117,"['Roland', 'Sneebs']"
"'Yes, that's him. He's been here for years. That's how I knew about the time being wrong. Sneebs got back to his own world once, and it was all different. He was so miserable he found another doorway and came straight back.'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,119,['Sneebs']
"'He said it was better to belong where you don't belong than not to belong where you used to belong, remembering when you used to belong there,' said Roland. 'At least, I think that's what he said. He said it's not too bad here if you keep out of the Queen's way. He says you can learn a lot.'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,121,"['Roland', 'Queen']"
"Tiffany looked back at the hunched figure of Sneebs, who was still watching the nut-cracking. He didn't look as though he was learning anything. He just looked like someone who'd been frightened for so long it had become part of his life, like freckles.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,122,['Sneebs']
"'But you mustn't make the Queen angry,' said Roland. 'I've seen what happens to people who make her angry. She sets the Bumble-Bee women on them.'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,123,"['Queen', 'Roland']"
"'Other things. I don't want to have to draw you a picture.' Roland shuddered. 'And if I did, I'd need a lot of red and purple crayons. Then they get dragged off and left for the dromes.' He shook his head. 'Listen, dreams are real here. Really real. When you're inside them you're not... exactly here. The nightmares are real, too. You can die.'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,127,['Roland']
"She looked down at her faded blue dress, with the bad stitching around the hem caused by it being let out and taken in as its various owners had grown. That was real.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,130,[]
"And she was real. Cheese was real. Somewhere not far away was a world of green turf under a blue sky, and that was real.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,131,[]
"The Nac Mac Feegle were real, and once again she wished they were here. There was something about the way they shouted 'Crivens!' and attacked everything in sight that was so very comforting.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,132,['Crivens']
"Almost everything else was really a dream, in a robber world that lived off the real worlds and where time nearly stood still and horrible things could happen at any moment. I don't want to know anything more about it, she decided. I just want to get my brother and go home, while I'm still angry.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,134,[]
"Because when I stop being angry, that'll be the time to get frightened again, and I'll be really frightened this time. Too frightened to think. As frightened as Sneebs. And I must think...",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,135,['Sneebs']
"'The first dream I fell into was like one of mine.' she said. 'I've had dreams where I wake up and I'm still asleep. But the ballroom, I've never'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,136,[]
"'Oh,that was one of mine,' said Roland. 'From when I was young. I woke up one night and went down to the big hall and there were all these people with masks on, dancing. It was just so... bright.' He looked wistful for a moment. 'That was when my mother was still alive.'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,137,['Roland']
"Tiffany stepped out into the heavy, shadowless light, and followed the path up the slope. Giant grasses arched overhead. Here and there more strangely dressed, strangely shaped people turned to watch her, but then acted as though she was just a passing wanderer, of no interest whatsoever.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,144,[]
"Tiffany's head shot round like a weathercock in a tornado. She ran along the path, head down, ready to swing the pan at anything that stood in her way, and burst through a clump of grass into a space lined with daisies. It could well have been a bower. She didn't bother to check.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,147,[]
"Wentworth was sitting on a large, flat stone, surrounded by sweets. Many of them were bigger than he was. Smaller ones were in piles, large ones lay like logs. And they were in every colour sweets can be, such as Not-Really-Raspberry Red, Fake-Lemon Yellow, Curiously-Chemical Orange, Some-Kind-of-Acidy Green and Who-Knows-What Blue.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,148,['Wentworth']
"Tears were falling off his chin in blobs. Since they were landing amongst the sweets, serious stickiness was already taking place.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,149,[]
"Wentworth howled. His mouth was a big red tunnel with the wobbly thing that no one knows the name of bouncing up and down in the back of his throat. He only stopped crying when it was time either to breathe in or die, and even then it was only for one huge sucking moment before the howl came back again.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,150,['Wentworth']
"Tiffany knew what the problem was immediately. She'd seen it before, at birthday parties. Her brother was suffering from tragic sweet deprivation. Yes, he was surrounded by sweets. But the moment he took any sweet at all, said his sugar-addled brain, that meant he was not taking all the rest. And there were so many sweets he'd never be able to eat them all. It was too much to cope with. The only solution was to burst into tears.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,151,[]
"The only solution at home was to put a bucket over his head until he calmed down, and take almost all the sweets away. He could deal with a few handfuls at a time.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,152,[]
"And this is where I meet the Queen, she thought. But there was no scream of rage, no explosion of magic... nothing.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,154,[]
"There was just the buzz of bees in the distance, and the sound of wind in the grass, and the gulping of Wentworth, who was too shocked to cry.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,155,[]
"She could see now that the far side of the bower contained a couch of leaves, surrounded by hanging flowers. But there was no one there.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,156,[]
"'Still behind you,' said the Queen. 'This is my world, child. You'll never be as fast as me, or as clever as me. Why are you trying to take my boy away?'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,160,['Queen']
"'Yes, that's a very witchy thing, isn't it,' said the voice of the Queen. 'Selfishness. Mine, mine, mine. All a witch cares about is what's hers.'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,164,[]
"And the Queen was there, in front of her. She was much taller than Tiffany, but just as slim; her hair was long and black, her face pale, her lips cherry red, her dress black and white and red. And it was all, very slightly, wrong.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,171,['Queen']
Tiffany's Second Thoughts said: It's because she's perfect. Completely perfect. Like a doll. No one real is as perfect as that.,13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,172,[]
"'Such rudeness, and you hardly know me,' she said, sitting down on the leafy seat. She patted the space beside her. 'Do sit down,' she said. 'Standing there like that is so confrontational. I will put your bad manners down to simple disorientation.' She gave Tiffany a beautiful smile.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,175,[]
"Look at the way her eyes move, said Tiffany's Second Thoughts. I don't think she's using them to see you with. They're just beautiful ornaments.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,176,[]
"'You have invaded my home, killed some of my creatures and generally acted in a mean and despicable way,' said the Queen. 'This offends me. However, I understand that you have been badly led by disruptive elements'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,177,['Queen']
"'You stole my brother,' said Tiffany, holding Wentworth tightly. 'You steal all sorts of things.' But her voice sounded weak and tinny in her ears.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,178,['Wentworth']
"And what there was about the Queen's voice was this: it said, in a friendly, understanding way, that she was right and you were wrong. And this wasn't your fault, exactly. It was probably the fault of your parents, or your food, or something so terrible you've completely forgotten about it. It wasn't your fault, the Queen understood, because you were a nice person. It was just such a terrible thing that all these bad influences had made you make the wrong choices. If only you'd admit that, Tiffany, then the world would be a much happier place",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,180,"['Queen', 'Queen']"
"this cold place, guarded by monsters, in a world where nothing grows older, or up, said her Second Thoughts. A world with the Queen in charge of everything. Don't listen.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,181,['Queen']
"She'd come to work as a maid at one of the farms many years ago. They said that she'd been brought up in a Home for the Destitute in Yelp. They said she'd been born there after her mother had arrived during a terrible storm and the master had written in his big black diary: 'To Miss Robinson, female infant', and her young mother hadn't been very bright and was dying in any case and had thought that was the baby's name. After all, it had been written down in an official book.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,185,['Robinson']
"Miss Robinson was quite old now, never said much, never ate much, but you never saw her not doing something. No one could scrub a floor like Miss Female Infant Robinson. She had a thin, wispy face with a pointed red nose, and thin, pale hands with red knuckles, which were always busy. Miss Robinson worked hard.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,186,"['Robinson', 'Infant Robinson', 'Robinson']"
"Tiffany hadn't understood a lot of what was going on when the crime happened. The women talked about it in twos and threes at garden gates, their arms folded, and they'd stop and look indignant if a man walked past.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,187,[]
"She picked up bits of conversation, though sometimes they seemed to be in a kind of code, like: 'Never really had anyone of her own, poor old soul. Wasn't her fault she was skinnier'n a rake,' and 'They say that when they found her she was cuddling it and said it was hers,' and 'The house was full of baby clothes she'd knitted!' That last one had puzzled Tiffany at the time, because it was said in the same tone of voice that someone'd use to say 'And the house was full of human skulls!'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,188,[]
But they all agreed on one thing: We can't have this. A crime's a crime. The Baron's got to be told.,13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,189,['Baron']
"Miss Robinson had stolen a baby, Punctuality Riddle, who had been much loved by his young parents even though they'd named him 'Punctuality' (reasoning that if children could be named after virtues like Patience, Faith and Prudence, what was wrong with a little good timekeeping?).",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,190,"['Robinson', 'Punctuality Riddle']"
"He'd been left in his crib in the yard, and had vanished. And there had been all the usual searchings and weepings, and then someone had mentioned that Miss Robinson had been taking home extra milk...",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,191,['Robinson']
"It was kidnapping. There weren't many fences on the Chalk, and very few doors with locks. Theft of all kinds was taken very seriously. If you couldn't turn your back on what was yours for five minutes, where would it all end? The law's the law. A crime's a crime...",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,192,[]
"Tiffany had overheard bits of arguments all over the village, but the same phrases cropped up over and over again. Poor thing never meant no harm. She was a hard worker, never complained. She's not right in the head. The law's the law. A crime's a crime.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,193,[]
"And so the Baron was told, and he held a court in the Great Hall, and everyone who wasn't wanted up on the hills turned up, including Mr and Mrs Riddle, she looking worried, he looking determined, and Miss Robinson, who just stared at the ground with her red knuckly hands on her knees.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,194,"['Baron', 'Mrs Riddle', 'Miss Robinson']"
"It was hardly a trial. Miss Robinson was confused about what she was guilty of, and it seemed to Tiffany that so was everyone else. They weren't certain why they were there, and they'd come to find out,",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,195,['Robinson']
"The Baron had been uneasy, too. The law was clear. Theft was a dreadful crime, and stealing a human being was much worse. There was a prison in Yelp, right beside the Home for the Destitute; some said there was even a connecting door. That was where thieves went.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,196,['Baron']
And the Baron wasn't a big thinker. His family had held the Chalk by not changing their mind about anything for hundreds of years. He sat and listened and drummed his fingers on the table and looked at people's faces and acted like a man sitting on a very hot chair.,13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,197,"['Baron', 'Chalk']"
"Tiffany was in the front row. She was there when the man started to give his verdict, 'um' ing and 'ah' ing, trying not to say the words he knew he'd have to say, when the door at the back of the hall opened and the sheepdogs Thunder and Lightning trotted in.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,198,[]
"They came down the aisle between the rows of benches and sat down in front of the Baron, looking bright-eyed and alert.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,199,['Baron']
Only Tiffany craned to see back up the aisle. The doors were still slightly ajar. They were far too heavy even for a strong dog to push them open. And she could just make out someone looking through the crack.,13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,200,[]
"And then, after a few moments, he pushed the law book aside and said: 'Perhaps we should do this a different way...'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,202,[]
"And there was a different way, involving people paying a little more attention to Miss Robinson. It wasn't perfect, and not everyone was happy, but it worked.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,203,['Miss Robinson']
"Tiffany smelled the scent of Jolly Sailor outside the hall when the meeting was over, and thought about the Baron's dog. 'Remember this day,' Granny Aching had said, and, 'Ye'll have cause to.'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,204,"['Baron', 'Granny Aching']"
"'There isn't anyone, is there?' said Tiffany, backing away. 'Is there anyone you've been kind to? Anyone who'll say you're not just a thief and a bully? Because that's what you are. You've got a... you're like the dromes, you've just got one trick...'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,209,[]
And there it was. Now she could see what her Third Thoughts had spotted. The Queen's face flickered for a moment.,13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,210,['Queen']
"'And that's not your body,' said Tiffany, plunging on. 'That's just what you want people to see. It's not real. It's just like everything else here, it's hollow and empty'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,211,[]
"The Queen ran forward and slapped her much harder than a dream should be able to. Tiffany landed in the moss and Wentworth rolled away, yelling, 'Wanna go-a toy-lut!'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,212,"['Queen', 'Wentworth']"
"Yes, said the Third Thoughts, because she doesn't know you can have Third Thoughts and your hand is only a few inches from the frying pan and things like her hate iron, don't they? She's angry. Now make her furious, so that she doesn't think. Hurt her.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,216,[]
"'You just live here in a land full of winter and all you do is dream of summers,' said Tiffany. 'No wonder the King went away.'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,217,[]
"The Queen stood still for a moment, like the beautiful statue she so much resembled. Again, the walking dream flickered and Tiffany thought she saw... something. It was not much bigger than her, and almost human, and a little shabby and, just for a moment, shocked. Then the Queen was back, tall and angry, and she drew a deep breath",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,218,"['Queen', 'Tiffany', 'Queen']"
"Tiffany grabbed the pan and swung it as she rolled onto her feet. It hit the tall figure only a glancing blow, but the Queen wavered like air over a hot road, and screamed.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,219,['Queen']
"Tiffany didn't wait to see what else was going to happen. She grabbed her brother again, and ran away, down through the grass, past the strange figures looking round at the sound of the Queen's anger.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,220,['Queen']
"Now shadows moved in the shadowless grasses. Some of the peoplethe joke people, the ones that looked like a flaps-on-the-pages picture bookchanged shape and started to move after Tiffany and her screaming brother.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,221,[]
"There was a booming noise on the other side of the clearing. The two huge creatures that Roland had called the Bumble-Bee women were rising off the ground, their tiny wings blurring with the effort.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,222,['Roland']
"'This is a dream!' Roland shouted, but it was louder now because he was catching her up. 'You're running right around'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,236,['Roland']
"'You know,' said the Queen, 'I really expected better of you, Tiffany. Now, give me back the boy, and I shall decide what to do next.'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,240,"['Queen', 'Tiffany']"
"'I could make a dream for you that's even smaller than you are,' said the Queen, pleasantly. 'That can be quite painful!'",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,242,['Queen']
"The colours were brighter. And sounds were louder. Tiffany could smell something, too, and what was strange about that was that up until now there had been no smells.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,243,[]
"It was a sharp, bitter smell that you never forgot. It was the smell of snow. And underneath the insect buzzings in the grass, she heard the faintest of voices.",13_The Wee Free Men,9,Chapter 10Master Stroke,244,[]
"On the other side of the clearing, where the nut-cracking man had been at work, was the last nut, half as high as Tiffany. And it was rocking gently. The cracker took a swipe at it with the hammer, and it rolled out of the way.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,0,[]
The Queen gave her a puzzled look. 'You find this funny?' she demanded. 'What's funny about this? What is amusing about this situation?',13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,2,['Queen']
"'I just had a funny thought,' said Tiffany. The Queen glared, as people without a sense of humour do when they're confronted with a smile.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,3,[]
"You're not very clever, thought Tiffany. You've never needed to be. You can get what you want just by dreaming it. You believe in your dreams, so you never have to think.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,4,['Tiffany']
"'I said goodbye,' said Tiffany, holding on tightly to her brother. 'I'm not handing my brother over, no matter what you do!'",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,8,[]
"'You know, you are right,' said the Queen. That kind of physical magic is, indeed, very hard. But I can make you think I've done the most... terrible things. And that, little girl, is all I need to do. Would you like to beg for mercy now? You may not be able to later.'",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,12,['Queen']
"The Queen leaned down. Her grey eyes filled Tiffany's world. 'People here will remember this for a long time,' she said.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,14,['Queen']
"Tiffany kicked her on the leg. It wasn't a witch thing. It was so nine years old, and she wished she could have thought of something better. On the other hand, she had hard boots and it was a good kick.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,19,['Tiffany']
The Queen shook her. 'Why did you do that?' she said. 'Why won't you do what I say? Everyone could be so happy if only they'd do what I say!',13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,20,['Queen']
"I know what you are, said her Third Thoughts. You're something that's never learned anything. You don't know anything about people. You're just... a child that's got old.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,22,[]
"There was a shout behind her. She twisted in the Queen's grip, and saw Roland fighting for the hammer. As she watched he turned desperately and raised the heavy thing over his head, knocking over the elf behind him.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,24,"['Queen', 'Roland']"
"Tiffany might have been the only person, in all the worlds that there are, to be happy to hear the sound of the Nac Mac Feegle.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,30,[]
"But they were all in a fighting mood and, to save time, were fighting with one another to get up to speed.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,32,[]
"The clearing... cleared. Real or dreams, the people could see trouble when it rolled towards them in a roaring, cursing, red and blue tide.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,33,[]
"Big Yan ran past, carrying a struggling full-sized elf over his head. Then he stopped suddenly, and tossed it high over the clearing.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,35,['Big Yan']
"The Nac Mac Feegles couldn't be trodden on, or squeezed. They worked in groups, running up one another's backs to get high enough to punch an elf or, for preference, bash it with their heads. And once anyone was down, it was all over bar the kicking.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,37,[]
"There was some method in the way the Nac Mac Feegle fought. For example, they always chose the biggest opponent because, as Rob Anybody said later, 'It makes them easier to hit, ye ken.' And they simply didn't stop. It was that which wore people down. It was like being attacked by wasps with fists.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,38,['Rob Anybody']
"It took them a little while to realize that they'd run out of people to fight. They carried on fighting one another for a bit anyway, since they'd come all this way, and then settled down and began to go through the pockets of the fallen in case there was any loose change.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,39,[]
"'Ach, weel, no' a bad job tho' I says it mysel',' said Rob Anybody, looking around. 'A very neat fight an' we dinnae e'en ha' to resort to usin' poetry.'",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,41,['Rob Anybody']
"'Only way we could find in,' said Rob Anybody. 'It's got to be a way that fits. 'Tis difficult work, navigatin' in dreams.'",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,43,['Rob Anybody']
"'Ach, no!' said Rob Anybody. 'Ye ken that dream wi' the big party? When you had the pretty frock an' a'? We got stuck in it.'",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,46,"['Rob Anybody', 'Ye ken', 'wi']"
"Rob looked a little shifty. 'Weeeel,' he said, 'we didnae get oout as easily as you. It took us a wee while.'",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,48,"['Rob', 'didnae']"
"'Aye, for most creatures,' said Rob Anybody. 'Not for us, though. Hooses, banks, dreams, 'tis a' the same to us. There's nothing we cannae get in or oot of.'",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,54,['Rob Anybody']
"'Oh, aye,' said Rob Anybody cheerfully. 'Gettin' oot o' pubs sometimes causes us a cerrrtain amount o' difficulty, I'll grant ye that.'",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,56,['Rob Anybody']
"'Ach, she did an offski as soon as we arrived,' said Rob Anybody. 'An' so should we, lady, afore the dream changes.' He nodded at Wentworth. 'Is this the wee bairn? Ach, what a noseful o' bogeys!'",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,58,"['Rob Anybody', 'Wentworth']"
"'Weeel, ye cannae ha' none!' shouted Rob Anybody. 'An' stop snivellin' and come awa' wi' us and stop bein' a burden to your wee sister!'",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,60,"['Weeel', 'Rob']"
"But she was very surprised, none the less. Wentworth never showed this much interest in anyone who wasn't a jelly baby.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,64,['Wentworth']
"'Rob, we've got a real one here,' a pictsie called out. To her horror, Tiffany saw that several of the Nac Mac Feegles were holding up Roland's unconscious head. He was full-length on the ground.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,65,"['Rob', 'Tiffany', 'Roland']"
"'Ah, that was the laddie who wuz rude to ye,' said Rob. 'An' he tried to hit Big Yan with a hammer, too. That wasnae a clever thing to try. What shall we do with him?'",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,66,['Rob']
'Er... er...' she said. The sense of a world beneath that had come to her when she was frightened of the Queen did not turn up so easily now. She tried to concentrate. The smell of snow...,13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,75,['Queen']
"It was ridiculous to talk about the smell of snow. It was just pure frozen water. But Tiffany always knew, when she woke up, if it had snowed in the night. Snow had a smell like the taste of tin. Tin did have a taste, although admittedly it tasted like the smell of snow.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,76,['Snow']
"She thought she heard her brain creak with the effort of thinking. If she was in a dream, she had to wake up. But it was no use running. Dreams were full of running. But there was one direction that looked... thin, and white.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,77,[]
"She shut her eyes, and thought about snow, crisp and white as fresh bedsheets. She concentrated on the feel of it under her feet. All she had to do was wake up...",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,78,[]
"Tiffany felt herself being lifted into the air. Nearby, a snoring Roland rose up on dozens of small blue legs as the Feegles got underneath him.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,83,['Roland']
"They skimmed over the snow, with parties of Feegles running on ahead. After a minute or two Tiffany looked behind them, and saw the blue shadows spreading. They were getting darker, too.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,85,[]
"Snow stung Tiffany's face. Trees blurred with the speed. The forest sped past. But the shadows were spreading across the path ahead and every time the party ran through them they seemed to have a certain solidity, like fog.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,90,['Snow']
"'Nightmares,' repeated Rob Anybody, turning to her. 'Ye wouldnae want to know about them. We'll hold 'em off. Ye must mak' a run for it. Get awa' wi' ye, noo!'",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,100,['Rob Anybody']
"She heard a high-pitched noise, a sort of chittering, insect noise, coming from the forest. The pictsies had drawn together. Usually they grinned like anything if they thought a fight was coming up, but this time they looked deadly serious.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,102,[]
"Tiffany turned to look at the horizon behind her. The boiling blackness was there, too, a ring that was closing in from all sides.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,104,[]
"'Ach, long-leggity things with muckle legs and huge teeth, and flappy wings and a hundred eyes, that kinda stuff,' said Daft Wullie.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,109,['Daft Wullie']
"Tiffany looked blank for a moment, and then shuddered. Oh yes, she knew about those nightmares. They didn't happen often, but they were horrible when they did. She'd woken up once shaking at the thought of Granny Aching's boots, which had been chasing her, and another time it was a box of sugar. Anything could be a nightmare.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,113,"[""Granny Aching's""]"
"'So what?' said Rob. He was staring at the line of nightmares. Things were visible in it, nowteeth, claws, eyes, ribs. From the way he was glaring it was obvious that, whatever happened later, the first few monsters were going to face a serious problem. If they had faces, anyway.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,118,['Rob']
"'There's no' a thing we cannae fight,' growled Big Yan. 'If it's got a heid, we can gi' it a faceful o' dandruff. If it disnae have a heid, it's due a good kickin'!'",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,120,['Big Yan']
'No!' said Tiffany. 'I'm not standing for this! The way to fight nightmares is to wake up! I am your kelda! This is an order! We're heading for those trees right now! Do what I say!',13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,126,['Tiffany']
"'Do it!' she yelled, so loudly that some of them flinched. 'Right now! Do what I tell you! There's a better way!'",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,129,[]
"'I'm going to get you home!' snapped Tiffany. I hope, she added to herself. But she'd seen a small, round, pale face staring at them around a tree trunk. There was a drome in those trees.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,131,[]
Sneebs was making a break for it. His arms pumped like pistons. His little legs seemed to spin. His cheeks were like balloons.,13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,134,['Sneebs']
"Tiffany pulled her hand out of her apron pocket, and opened up the crumpled wrapper of Jolly Sailor tobacco. It was something to focus on, to remind her of a dream...",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,138,[]
"People said you could see the sea from the very top of the downs, but Tiffany had stared hard on a fine winter's day, when the air was clear, and seen nothing but the hazy blue of distance. But the sea on the Jolly Sailor packet was deep blue, with white crests on the waves. It was the sea, for Tiffany.",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,139,['Tiffany']
It had looked like a small drome in the trees. That meant it wasn't very powerful. She hoped so. She had to hope so...,13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,140,[]
"The trees got closer. So did the ring of nightmares. Some of the sounds were horrible, of cracking bones and crushing rocks and stinging insects and screaming cats, getting nearer and nearer and nearer",13_The Wee Free Men,10,Chapter 11Awakening,141,[]
"there was sand around her, and white waves crashing, and water draining off the shingle and sounding like an old woman sucking a hard mint.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,0,[]
"Tiffany looked down, and giggled. Every pictsie was wearing a Jolly Sailor outfit, with an oilskin coat and a huge yellow oilskin rain hat that covered most of their faces. They started to wander about, bumping into one another.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,3,[]
My dream! Tiffany thought. The drome uses what it can find in your head... but this is my dream. I can use it.,13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,4,['Tiffany']
"There was a boat pulled up on the shingle. As one pictsie, or small yellow mushroom, the Nac Mac Feegles were flocking towards it and clambering up the sides.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,6,[]
"'Ach, the Quin finds a way in everywhere,' said Rob, as a hundred pictsies raised an oar. 'Dinnae fash yersel', we know all about boats. Did ye no' see Not-totally-wee Georgie pike fishin' wi' Wee Bobby in the stream the other day? We is no strangers to the piscatorial an' nautical arts, ye ken.'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,10,"['Quin', 'Rob', 'wi', 'Wee Bobby', 'ye ken']"
"And they did indeed seem to know about boats. The oars were heaved into the rowlocks, and a party of Feegles pushed it down the stones and into the waves.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,11,[]
"'Now you just hand us the wee bairn,' shouted Rob Anybody from the stern. Uncertainly, her feet slipping on the wet stones, Tiffany waded through the cold water and handed Wentworth over.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,12,"['Rob', 'Tiffany waded']"
"'Weewee mens!' he yelled, as they lowered him into the boat. It was his only joke, so he wasn't going to stop.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,14,[]
"'Aye, that's right,' said Rob Anybody, tucking him under the seat. 'Noo just you bide there like a good boy and no yellin' for sweeties or Uncle Rob'll gi' ye a skelpin' across the earhole, OK?'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,15,"['Rob Anybody', ""Uncle Rob'll""]"
Tiffany ran back up the beach and hauled Roland to his feet. He opened his eyes and looked blearily at her.,13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,17,['Roland']
"'Of course!' Tiffany hauled herself in afterwards, and landed in the bottom of the boat as a wave took it. The oars creaked and splashed, and the boat jerked forward. It jolted once or twice as more waves hit it, and then began to plunge across the sea. The pictsies were strong, after all. Even though each oar was a battleground as pictsies hung from it, or piled up on one another's shoulders or just heaved anything they could grasp, both oars were almost bending as they were dragged through the water.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,21,[]
"'Aye, I ken that,' said Rob Anybody. 'It's the only place there is! And the Quin disnae like light.' He grinned. 'It's a good dream, lady. Have ye no' looked at the sky?'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,24,"['ken', 'Rob Anybody', 'Quin']"
"Tiffany turned. It was a blue sky. Very blue. But above the retreating beach, halfway up the sky, was a band of yellow. It looked a long way away, and hundreds of miles across. And in the middle of it, looming over the world as big as a galaxy and grey-blue with distance, was a lifebelt.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,27,[]
'But the sea feels... real. It's salty and wet and cold. It's not like paint! I didn't dream it salty or so cold!',13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,32,[]
"'Nae kiddin'? Then it's a picture on the outside, and it's real on the inside.' Rob nodded. 'Ye ken, we've been robbin' an' runnin' aroound on all kinds o' worlds for a lang time, and I'll tell ye this: the universe is a lot more comp-li-cated than it looks from the ooutside.'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,33,"[""Nae kiddin'"", 'Rob', 'Ye ken']"
"Tiffany took the grubby label out of her pocket and stared at it again. There was the lifebelt, and the lighthouse. But the Jolly Sailor himself wasn't there. What was there, so tiny as to be little bigger than a dot on the printed sea, was a tiny rowing boat.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,34,[]
"She looked up. There were storm clouds in the sky, in front of the huge, hazy lifebelt. They were long and ragged, curling as they came.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,35,[]
"Tangling and tumbling, some of the clouds passed overhead and then swooped towards the sea. They vanished beneath the waves like a waterspout in reverse.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,38,[]
"But, against all normal rules, it was now trying to go uphill. The water was mounding up and up, and the boat washed backwards in the streaming surf.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,43,[]
Something was rising. Something white was pushing the seas aside. Great waterfalls poured off the shining dome that climbed towards the storm sky.,13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,44,[]
"It rose higher, and still there was more. And, eventually, there was an eye. It was tiny compared to the mountainous head above it, and it rolled in its socket and focused on the tiny boat.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,45,[]
"'Now, that's a heid that be a day's work e'en for Big Yan,' said Rob Anybody. 'I reckon we'd have to come back tomorrow! Row, boys!'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,46,"['Big Yan', 'Rob Anybody']"
"I never dreamed the smell, though, she added to herself. But here it is, a huge, solid, world-filling smell of salt and water and fish and ooze",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,48,[]
"'Ah, I know that,' said Tiffany, as the boat rocked on the swell. 'Whales aren't dangerous, because they just eat very small things...'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,50,[]
"'I paid a whole cucumber once for a lesson on Beasts of the Deep,' said Tiffany, as a wave washed over them. 'Whales don't even have proper teeth!'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,53,[]
"There was a creaking sound and a gust of fishy halitosis about the size of a typhoon, and the view was full of enormous, pointy teeth.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,54,[]
"The surge of water was pushing them away. And Tiffany could see the whole of the head now and, in a way she couldn't possibly describe, the whale looked like the Queen. The Queen was there, somewhere.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,56,['Tiffany']
"'This is my dream,' she shouted at the sky. 'I've dreamed it dozens of times! You're not allowed in here! And whales don't eat people! Everyone who isn't very stupid knows that!'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,58,[]
"Grumbling, because even if they were facing the right way they were still going the wrong way, the pictsies hauled on the oars.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,68,[]
"'That's a great big heid he's got there, ye ken,' said Rob Anybody. 'How big would you say that heid is, gonnagle?'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,69,"['ye ken', 'Rob Anybody']"
"'Ach, I'd say it's verrra big, Rob,' said William, who was with the team on the other oar. 'Indeed, I might commit myself to sayin' it's enorrrrmous.'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,70,"['Rob', 'William']"
"'An' how near us would you say it is, then?' asked Rob conversationally, as the boat wallowed and jerked just ahead of the whale.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,75,['Rob']
"Any moment now, thought Tiffany. I know Miss Tick said you shouldn't believe in your dreams, but she meant you shouldn't just hope.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,77,['Tick']
"Tiffany swallowed, and hoped that the whale wouldn't. There was only about thirty yards of water between the teeth and the boat.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,80,[]
"Tiffany looked up, her mouth open. White sails flashed across the storm clouds, pouring rain like waterfalls. She looked up at rigging and ropes and sailors lined up on the spars, and cheered.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,82,[]
"And then the stern of the Jolly Sailor's ship was disappearing into the rain and mist, but not before Tiffany saw the big bearded figure at the wheel, dressed in yellow oilskins. He turned and waved just once, before the ship vanished into the murk.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,83,[]
"She managed to stand up again, as the boat rocked in the swell, and yelled at the towering whale: 'You've got to chase him! That's how it has to work! You chase him, he chases you! Granny Aching said so! You can't not do it and still be the whale fish! This is my dream! My rules! I've had more practice at it than you!'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,84,['Granny Aching']
"'That's right!' Tiffany said, delighted. 'Big fishy! And what makes it particularly interesting it that a whale isn't a fish! It is in fact a mammal, just like a cow!'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,88,[]
"Did you just say that? said her Second Thoughts, as all the pictises stared at her and the boat spun in the surf. The first time he's ever said anything that wasn't about sweeties or weewee and you just corrected him?",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,89,[]
"Tiffany looked at the whale. It was having trouble. But it was the whale, the whale she'd dreamed about many times after Granny Aching had told her that story, and not even the Queen could control a story like that.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,90,"['Granny Aching', 'Queen']"
"'It's just that he ought to get it right,' she mumbled, ashamed of herself. 'It's a mistake lots of people make...'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,95,[]
"'Yes,' said a voice, and Tiffany realized that it was hers again. The anger rose up, joyfully. 'Yes! I'mme, I am careful and logical and I look up things I don't understand! When I hear people use the wrong words I get edgy! I am good with cheese. I read books fast! I think! And I always have a piece of string! That's the kind of person I am!'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,97,[]
"'Is it OK wi' you if we get on?' said Rob Anybody, holding up a nervous hand. 'Before yon whale fi Before yon whale cow comes back?'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,102,['Rob Anybody']
"'Yes, please. Er... thank you,' she said, calming down a bit. The ship and the whale had vanished into the rain and the sea was merely lapping at the shore.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,104,[]
"A drome was sitting on the rocks with its pale, fat legs sticking out in front of it. It was staring out to sea and didn't appear to notice the approaching boat. It thinks it's home, Tiffany thought. I've given it a dream it likes.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,105,['Tiffany']
"'Leave it alone. Just... leave it alone, all right? It's not interested.' And it knows about sea, she added to herself. It's probably homesick for the sea. That's why it's such a real dream. I'd have never have got it right by myself.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,110,[]
"It looks as though a drome can get lost in its own dream, she thought. I wonder if it'll ever wake up?",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,112,[]
"She turned to the Nac Mac Feegles. 'In my dream I always wake up when I reach the lighthouse,' she said.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,113,[]
"'We dinnae trust the Quin,' said Rob. 'She'll let ye think ye're safe, and just when ye've dropped your guard she'll leap oout. She'll be waitin' behind the door, ye can bet on it. Ye'll let us go in first.'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,115,"['Quin', 'Rob']"
"It was an instruction, not a question. Tiffany nodded, and watched the Nac Mac Feegles swarm over the rocks towards the tower.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,116,[]
"Alone on the jetty, except for Wentworth and the unconscious Roland, she lifted the toad out of her pocket. It opened its yellow eyes and stared at the sea.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,117,"['Wentworth', 'Roland']"
"'Where are the notices warning people they could drown?' complained the toad. 'No lifebelts or shark nets. Oh, dear. Do I see a qualified lifeguard? I think not. Supposing someone was to  '",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,122,[]
"But nothing happened. It was followed by nothing else happening. Wentworth picked up a pebble from the shingle and put it in his mouth, on the basis that anything might be a sweetie.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,129,['Wentworth']
"Then, suddenly, there were noises from the lighthouse. Tiffany heard muffled shouts, and thuds, and once or twice the sound of breaking glass. At one point there was a noise like something heavy falling down a long spiral staircase and hitting every step on the way.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,130,[]
"'I'll wake up when I go through the door,' said Tiffany, pulling Roland out of the boat. 'I always have. It must work. This is my dream.' She hauled the boy upright and turned to the nearest Feegle. 'Can you bring Wentworth?'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,136,"['Roland', 'Wentworth']"
"Rob Anybody looked offended. 'We ne'er get lost!' he said. 'We always ken where we are! It's just sometimes mebbe we aren't sure where everything else is, but it's no' our fault if everything else gets lost! The Nac Mac Feegle are never lost!'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,139,"['Rob Anybody', 'ken']"
"'We've ne'er been lost in oour lives! Is that no' the case, lads?' said Rob Anybody. There was a murmur of resentful agreement. 'The words ""lost"" and ""Nac Mac Feegle"" shouldnae turn up in the same sentence!'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,141,['Rob Anybody']
"'Well, at least there shouldn't have been anything to drink in a lighthouse,' said Tiffany. She laughed. 'Unless you drank the lamp oil, and no one would dare do that!'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,144,[]
"'What would that be, then?' said Daft Wullie, in a slow, careful voice. 'Would it be the stuff in a kind o' big bottle kind o' thingie?'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,146,['Daft Wullie']
"'Well, you'd be very, very sick, then,' said Tiffany. She gave him a strong look. 'It's inflammable, too. It's a good job you didn't drink it, isn't it...'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,152,[]
"'Big Yan said that showed it wuz strong stuff! An' things ha' come to a pretty pass, ye ken, if people are going to leave stuff like that aroound where innocent people could accidentally smash the door doon and lever the bars aside and take the big chain off'f the cupboard and pick the lock and drink it!'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,157,"['Big Yan', 'ye ken']"
"'OK, OK, dinnae panic. No belchin', and none ofyouse is to tak' a leak anywhere near any naked flames, OK? And act nat'ral.'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,160,[]
"Tiffany smiled to herself. Pictsies seemed very hard to kill. Perhaps believing you were already dead made you immune. She turned and looked towards the lighthouse door. She had never actually seen it opened in her dream. She'd always thought that the lighthouse was full of light, on the basis that on the farm the cowshed was full of cows and the woodshed was full of wood.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,161,['Pictsies']
"'All right, all right,' she said, looking down at Rob Anybody. 'I'm going to carry Roland, and I want you to bring Wentworth.'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,162,"['Rob', 'Roland', 'Wentworth']"
"'You bring him,' said Tiffany shortly. She meant: I'm not sure this is going to work, and he might be safer with you than with me. I hope I'm going to wake up in my bedroom. Waking up in my bedroom would be nice...",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,165,[]
"Of course, if everyone else wakes up there, too, there might be some difficult questions asked, but anything's better than the Queen",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,166,[]
"There was a rushing, rattling noise behind her. She turned, and saw the sea disappearing, very quickly. It was pulling back down the shore. As she watched, rocks and clumps of seaweed rose above the surf and then were suddenly high and dry.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,167,[]
"'Ah,' she said, after a moment. 'It's all right. I know what this is. It's the tide. The sea does this. It goes in and out every day.'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,168,[]
"About fifty yards away the last rivulets of sea water were disappearing over an edge, and some of the pictsies were already heading towards it.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,170,[]
"Tiffany suddenly had a moment of something that wasn't exactly panic. It was a lot slower and nastier than panic. It began with just a nagging little doubt, that said: isn't the tide a bit slower?",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,171,[]
"The teacher(Wonders of the Nattral Wurld, One Apple) hadn't gone into much detail. But there were fish flapping on the exposed sea bed, and surely the fish in the sea didn't die every day?",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,172,[]
"They'd reached the edge, where the rest of the pictsies were lined up. A little bit of water still trickled over their feet, pouring down into the gulf beyond.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,177,[]
"It was like looking down into a valley. At the far side, miles and miles away, the retreating sea was just a gleaming line.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,178,[]
"Below them, though, were the shipwrecks. There were a lot of them. Galleons and schooners and clippers, masts broken, rigging hanging, hulls breached, lay strewn across the puddles in what had been the bay.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,179,[]
"'That's right,' said Rob Anybody. There's got t'be gold in sunken ships, otherwise it wouldnae be worth fighting all them sharkies and octopussies and stuff. Stealin' treasure fra' the ocean's bed, that's aboout the biggest, best thievin' ever!'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,188,['Rob Anybody']
"'That's a lighthouse!' she said, pointing. 'Can you see it? A lighthouse so ships don't run into the rocks! Right? Understand? This is a trap made just for you! The Queen's still around!'",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,190,['Queen']
"What looked like a cloud on the horizon was getting bigger, and glittering as it came. Tiffany could already hear the roar.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,193,[]
"She ran back up the beach and got her hands under Roland's armpits, so that she could drag him to the lighthouse. She looked back, and the pictsies were still watching the huge, surging wave.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,194,['Roland']
"And there was Wentworth, watching the wave happily, and bending down slightly so that, if they stood on tiptoe, he could hold hands with two Feegles.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,195,['Wentworth']
"The image branded itself on her eyes. The little boy, and the pictsies, all with their backs to her, and all staring with interest at the rushing, glittering, sky-filling wall of water.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,196,[]
"Tiffany managed to haul Roland across her shoulder and, staggering across the rocks, made it to the lighthouse door as the water crashed behind her",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,200,['Roland']
"It was the silent, cold land of the Queen. There was no one around and nothing to see except snow and, in the distance, the forest. Black clouds hovered over it.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,203,[]
"Ahead of her, and only just visible, was a picture in the air. It showed some turf, and a few stones, lit with moonlight.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,204,[]
"No one and nothing tried to stop her. The snow spilled a little way through the doorway between the stones and onto the turf, but the air was warm and alive with night-time insect noises. Under a real moon, under a real sky, she pulled the boy over to a fallen stone and sat him up against it. She sat down next to him, exhausted to the bone, and tried to get her breath back.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,211,[]
"They could still be alive. It was a dream, after all. There must be a way back. All I have to do is find it. I've got to go back in there.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,214,[]
"And as she watched, they fell down. The one on the left slipped over, slowly, and the other two ended up leaning against it.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,218,[]
"She ran over and hauled at the tons of stone. She prodded the air around them in case the doorway was still there. She squinted madly, trying to see it.",13_The Wee Free Men,11,Chapter 12Jolly Sailor,219,[]
"The Queen walked over the turf towards Tiffany. Where she'd trodden, frost gleamed for a moment. The little part of Tiffany that was still thinking thought: That grass will be dead in the morning. She's killing my turf.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,0,['Queen']
"'The whole of life is but a dream, when you come to think of it,' said the Queen in the same infuriatingly calm, pleasant voice. She sat down on the fallen stones. 'You humans are such dreamers. You dream that you're clever. You dream that you're important. You dream that you're special. You know, you're almost better than dromes. You're certainly more imaginative. I have to thank you.'",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,1,['Queen']
"'What for?' said Tiffany, looking at her boots. Terror clamped her body in red-hot wires. There wasn't anywhere to run to.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,2,[]
"'I never realized how wonderful your world is,' said the Queen. 'I mean, the dromes... well, they're not much more than a kind of walking sponge, really. Their world is ancient. It's nearly dead. They're not really creative any more. With a little help from me, your people could be a lot better. Because, you see, you dream all the time.You, especially, dream all the time. Your picture of the world is a landscape with you in the middle of it, isn't it? Wonderful. Look at you, in that rather horrible dress and those clumpy boots. You dreamed you could invade my world with a frying pan. You had this dream about Brave Girl Rescuing Little Brother. You thought you were the heroine of a story. And then you left him behind. You know, I think being hit by a billion tons of sea water must be like having a mountain of iron drop on your head, don't you?'",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,3,"['Queen', 'Brave Girl']"
"'But he's not yours,' said the Queen. 'He is, let us face it, a rather stupid boy with a big red face and brains made of pork, just like his father. You left your little brother behind with a bunch of little thieves and you rescued a spoiled little fool.'",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,7,['Queen']
"There was no time! shrieked the Third Thoughts. You wouldn't have got to him and got back to the lighthouse! You nearly didn't get away as it was! You got Roland out! It was the logical thing to do! You don't have to be guilty about it! What's better, to try to save your brother and be brave, courageous, stupid and dead, or save the boy and be brave, courageous, sensible and alive?",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,8,['Roland']
Something kept saying: Would you say to Mum that you could see there wasn't time to rescue your brother so you rescued someone else instead? Would she be pleased that you'd worked that out? Being right doesn't always work.,13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,10,[]
"'I expect it's not your fault you're so cold and heartless,' said the Queen. 'It's probably all to do with your parents. They probably never gave you enough time. And having Wentworth was a very cruel thing to do, they really should have been more careful. And they let you read too many words. It can't be good for a young brain, knowing words like paradigm and eschatological. It leads to behaviour such as using your own brother as monster bait.' The Queen sighed. 'Sadly, that kind of thing happens all the time. I think you should be proud of not being worse than just deeply introverted and socially maladjusted.'",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,12,"['Queen', 'Wentworth', 'Queen']"
"'It's so sad,' she continued. 'You dream that you are strong, sensible, logical... the kind of person who always has a bit of string. But that's just your excuse for not being really, properly human. You're just a brain, no heart at all. You didn't even cry when Granny Aching died. You think too much, and now your precious thinking has let you down. Well, I think it's best if I just kill you, don't you?'",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,14,['Granny Aching']
"Tiffany was aware of other figures in the gloom. There were some of the people from the summer pictures, but there were also dromes and the headless horseman and the Bumble-Bee women.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,16,[]
"She should have been better organized, she thought dully. She shouldn't have relied on dreams. Or... perhaps I should have been a real human being. More... feeling. But I couldn't help not crying! It just... wouldn't come! And how can I stop thinking? And thinking about thinking? And even thinking about thinking about thinking?",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,20,[]
"She saw the smile in the Queen's eyes, and thought: Which one of all those people doing all that thinking is me?",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,21,['Queen']
"Clouds poured across the sky like a stain. They covered the stars. They were the inky clouds from the frozen world, the clouds of nightmare. It began to rain, rain with ice in it. It hit the turf like bullets, turning it into chalky mud. The wind howled like a pack of grimhounds.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,23,[]
"Tiffany tried another step, but things were not working any more. She was too cold and too tired. She could feel her self disappearing, getting lost...",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,26,[]
"The rain grew harder, stinging like needles, hammering on her head and running like icy tears down her cheeks. It struck so hard it left her breathless.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,29,[]
"She felt the cold drawing all the heat out of her. And that was the only sensation left, apart from a musical note.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,30,[]
"She couldn't feel the ground under her and there was nothing to see, not even the stars. The clouds had covered everything.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,32,[]
"She was so cold she couldn'tfeel the cold any more, or her fingers. A thought managed to trickle through her freezing mind. Is there any me at all? Or do my thoughts just dream of me?",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,33,[]
"The blackness grew deeper. Night was never as black as this, and winter never as cold. It was colder than the deep winters when the snow came down and Granny Aching would plod from snowdrift to snowdrift, looking for warm bodies. The sheep could survive the snow if the shepherd had some wits, Granny used to say. The snow kept the cold away, the sheep surviving in warm hollows under roofs of snow while a bitter wind blew harmlessly over them.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,34,"['Granny Aching', 'Granny']"
"But this was as cold as those days when even the snow couldn't fall, and the wind was pure cold itself, blowing ice crystals across the turf. Those were the killer days in early spring, when the lambing had begun and winter came howling down one more time...",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,35,[]
"It tumbled through the warm, heavy darkness around her, something like snow but as fine as dust. It piled up somewhere below her, because she could see a faint whiteness.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,49,[]
"This is the million-year rain under the sea, this is the new land being born underneath an ocean. It's not a dream. It's... a memory. The land under wave. Millions and millions of tiny shells...",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,53,[]
"All the time there was the warm, comforting smell of the shepherding hut, and the feeling of being held in invisible hands.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,55,[]
"The whiteness below her rose up and over her head, but it didn't seem uncomfortable. It was like being in a mist.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,56,[]
"She wasn't sure how long she spent in the warm deep water, or if indeed any time really had passed, or if the millions of years went past in a second, but she felt movement again, and a sense of rising.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,58,[]
"There's always been someone watching the borders. They didn't decide to. It was decided for them. Someone has to care. Sometimes, they have to fight. Someone has to speak for that which has no voice...",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,60,[]
"She opened her eyes. She was still lying in the mud, and the Queen was laughing at her and, overhead, the storm still raged.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,61,['Queen']
"But she felt warm. In fact, she felt hot, red-hot with anger... anger at the bruised turf, anger at her own stupidity, anger at this beautiful creature whose only talent was control.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,62,[]
"All witches are selfish, the Queen had said. But Tiffany's Third Thoughts said: Then turn selfishness into a weapon! Make all things yours! Make other lives and dreams and hopes yours! Protect them! Save them! Bring them into the sheepfold! Walk the gale for them! Keep away the wolf! My dreams! My brother! My family! My land! My world! How dare you try to take these things, because they are mine!",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,64,['Queen']

"Clouds panicked and scattered, but always there was a comet streaking across the sky and they were turned. Monstrous shapes writhed and screamed in the boiling sky, but Thunder and Lightning had worked many flocks; there was an occasional snap of lightning-sparked teeth, and a wail. Tiffany stared upwards, rain pouring off her face, and shouted commands that no dog could possibly have heard.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,74,[]
"Jostling and rumbling and screaming, the storm rolled off the hills and away towards the mountains, where there were deep canyons that could pen it.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,75,[]
"Out of breath, glowing with triumph, Tiffany watched until the dogs came back and settled, once again, on the turf. And then she remembered something else: it didn't matter what orders she gave those dogs. They were not her dogs. They were working dogs.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,76,[]
She'd have turned if someone had told her a horrible monster was behind her. She'd have turned if they'd said it had a thousand teeth. She didn't want to turn round now. Forcing herself was the hardest thing she'd ever done.,13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,80,[]
"She was not afraid of what she might see. She was terribly, mortally frightened, afraid to the centre of her bones of what she might not see.

"Sparkling in the dark, light glittering off the white shepherdess dress and every blue ribbon and silver buckle of it, was Granny Aching, smiling hugely, glowing with pride. In one hand she held the huge ornamental crook, hung with blue bows.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,83,['Granny Aching']

"Real starlit darkness covered the turf, and the night-time sounds filled the air.

And now",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,86,[]
"'But I'm still here,' said the Queen, stepping in front of her. 'Perhaps it was all a dream. Perhaps you have gone a little mad, because you are after all a very strange child. Perhaps you had help.

"... and then, like someone rising from the clouds of a sleep, she felt the deep, deep Time below her.

I've been given something for a while, and the price of it is that I have to give it back.",13_The Wee Free Men,12,Chapter 13Land Under Wave,152,['Queen']
"And the reward is giving it back, too. No human could live like this. You could spend a day looking at a flower to see how wonderful it is, and that wouldn't get the milking done.

"The lowest one had two figures on it. As it landed, Tiffany saw that one of them was Miss Tick, clinging anxiously onto a smaller figure who'd been doing the steering.

"Mistress Weatherwax gave Tiffany a look that went right through her head and about five miles out the other side. Then she walked over to the stones, and waved one hand. It was an odd movement, a kind of wriggle in the air, but for a moment it left a glowing line. There was a noise, a chord, as though all sorts of sounds were happening at the same time. It snapped into silence.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,70,['Weatherwax']
"The witch waved a hand again. There was another sharp, complicated noise. Mistress Weatherwax turned suddenly and stared at the distant pimple that was the pictsie mound.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,73,['Weatherwax']

I show you respect as you in turn will respect me.' The air seemed to freeze for a moment and the skies to darken. Then Mistress Weatherwax went on, as if the moment of thunder hadn't happened: 'But if one day you care to tell me more, I should be grateful to hear about it,' she said, in a conversational voice. 'And them creatures that look like they're made of dough, I should like to know more about them, too. Never run across them before. And your grandmother sounds the kind of person I would have liked to meet.' She straightened up.

It's all about how you are... you, I suppose.'",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,108,['Tiffany']
"'Nicely said,' said Mistress Weatherwax. 'You're sharp. But there's magic, too. You'll pick that up. It don't take much intelligence, otherwise wizards wouldn't be able to do it.'",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,109,['Weatherwax']
"'You'll need a job, too,' said Mrs Ogg. There's no money in witchcraft. Can't do magic for yourself, see? Cast-iron rule.'",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,110,['Mrs Ogg']

"'Well, I've helped deliver difficult lambs,' said Tiffany. 'And I saw my brother being born. They didn't bother to turn me out. It didn't look too difficult. But I think cheese is probably easier, and less noisy.'",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,113,['Tiffany']
"'We look to... the edges,' said Mistress Weatherwax. 'There're a lot of edges, more than people know. Between life and death, this world and the next, night and day, right and wrong... an' they need watchin'. We watch 'em, we guard the sum of things. And we never ask for any reward. That's important.'",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,117,['Weatherwax']
"'People give us stuff, mind you. People can be very gen'rous to witches,' said Mrs Ogg, happily. 'On bakin' days in our village, sometimes I can't move for cake. There's ways and ways of not askin', if you get my meaning. People like to see a happy witch.'",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,118,['Mrs Ogg']
"'But down here people think witches are bad!' said Tiffany, and her Second Thoughts added: Remember how rarely Granny Aching ever had to buy her own tobacco?",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,119,['Granny Aching']
"'And we have to hurry,' said Mistress Weatherwax. There's a man riding up here on a farm horse. Fair hair, red face'",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,121,['Weatherwax']
"'Well, he's making the poor thing gallop,' said Mistress Weatherwax. 'Quick, now. You want to learn the skills? When can you leave home?'",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,123,['Weatherwax']
"'Well, when you're a bit older than you. Miss Tick here will come and find you,' said Mistress Weatherwax. Miss Tick nodded. 'There're elderly witches up in the mountains who'll pass on what they know in exchange for a bit of help around the cottage. This place will be watched over while you're gone, you may depend on it. In the meantime you'll get three meals a day, your own bed, use of broomstick... that's the way we do it. All right?'",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,127,"['Tick', 'Weatherwax', 'Tick']"
"'Yes,' said Tiffany, grinning happily. The wonderful moment was passing too quickly for all the questions she wanted to ask. 'Yes! But, er...'",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,128,[]
"'Unless you want to,' said Mrs Ogg, standing up. 'There's no harm in an occasional cackle, if the mood takes you that way. I'd teach you a good one right now, but we really ought to be going.'",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,133,['Mrs Ogg']
'But... but how did you manage it?' said Miss Tick to Tiffany. This is all chalk! You've become a witch on chalk? How?',13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,134,['Tick to']
"'That's all you know, Perspicacia Tick,' said Mistress Weatherwax. The bones of the hills is flint. It's hard and sharp and useful. King of stones.'

"'If it's my trouble, I'll get out of it,' said Tiffany. She wanted to say: Yes, yes! I'm going to need help! I don't know what's going to happen when my father gets here! The Baron's probably got really angry! But I don't want them to think I can't deal with my own problems! I ought to be able to cope!",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,138,['Baron']
"'The thing about witchcraft,' said Mistress Weatherwax, 'is that it's not like school at all. First you get the test, and then afterwards you spend years findin' out how you passed it. It's a bit like life in that respect.' She reached out and gently raised Tiffany's chin so that she could look into her face. 'I see you opened your eyes,' she said.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,142,['Weatherwax']
"She stretched out a hand and made a circle in the air around Tiffany's hair, then brought her hand up over the head while making little movements with her forefinger.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,145,[]
"Tiffany raised her hands to her head. For a moment she thought there was nothing there, and then they touched... something. It was more like a sensation in the air; if you weren't expecting it to be there, your fingers passed straight through.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,146,[]

"Her stick rose gently in the air. From the stick of Mistress Weatherwax, though, there was merely a sad little noise, like the thwop of Miss Tick's hat point. The broomstick went kshugagugah.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,156,"['Weatherwax', 'Tick']"
"Mistress Weatherwax sighed. 'It's them dwarfs,' she said. They say they've repaired it, oh yes, and it starts first time in their workshop'",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,157,['Weatherwax']
"They heard the sound of distant hooves. With surprising speed, Mistress Weatherwax swung herself off the stick, grabbed it firmly in both hands, and ran away across the turf, skirts billowing behind her.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,158,['Weatherwax']
"She was a speck in the distance when Tiffany's father came over the brow of the hill on one of the farm horses. He hadn't even stopped to put the leather shoes on it; great slices of earth flew up as hooves the size of large soup plates, [Probably about eleven inches across. Tiffany didn't measure them this time.] each one shod with iron, bit into the turf.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,159,[]

"The overjoyed Baron, however, was very certain. Obviously thisthis Queen woman, whoever she was, had been stealing children but Roland had beaten her, oh yes, and helped these two young children to get back as well.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,164,"['Baron', 'Roland']"

"She heard the Baron and her father talking downstairs. She heard the story being woven between them as they tried to make sense of it all. Obviously the girl had been very brave (this was the Baron speaking) but, well, she was nine, wasn't she? And didn't even know how to use a sword! Whereas Roland had fencing lessons at his school...",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,166,"['Baron', 'Baron', 'Roland']"

"Tiffany lay in bed and smelled the ointment her mother had rubbed into her temples. Tiffany must have got hit on the head, she'd said, because of the way she kept on touching it.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,168,[]
"So... Roland with the beefy face was the hero, was he? And she was just like the stupid princess who broke her ankle and fainted all the time? That was completely unfair!",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,169,['Roland']
"She reached out to the little table beside her bed where she'd put the invisible hat. Her mother had put down a cup of broth right through it, but it was still there. Tiffany's fingers felt, very faintly, the roughness of the brim.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,170,[]
"We never ask for any reward, she thought. Besides, it was her secret, all of it. No one else knew about the Wee Free Men. Admittedly Wentworth had taken to running through the house with a tablecloth round his waist shouting, 'Weewee mens! I'll scone you in the boot!' but Mrs Aching was still so glad to see him back, and so happy that he was talking about things other than sweets, that she wasn't paying too much attention to what hewas talking about.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,171,"['Wentworth', 'Mrs Aching']"

"On the third day, it rained. Tiffany went into the kitchen when no one was about and took down the china shepherdess from the shelf. She put it in a sack, then slipped out of the house and ran up onto the downs.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,179,[]
"The worst of the weather was going either side of the Chalk, which cut through the clouds like the prow of a ship. But when Tiffany reached the spot where an old stove and four iron wheels stood out of the grass, and cut a square of turf, and carefully chipped out a hole for the china shepherdess, and then put the turf back... it was raining hard enough to soak it in and give it a chance of surviving. It seemed the right thing to do. And she was sure she caught a whiff of tobacco.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,180,['Tiffany']
"Then she went to the pictsies' mound. She'd worried about that. She knew they were there, didn't she? So, somehow, going to check that they were there would be... sort of... showing that she doubted if they would be, wouldn't it? They were busy people. They had lots to do. They had the old kelda to mourn. They were probably very busy. That's what she told herself. It wasn't because she kept wondering if there really might be nothing down the hole but rabbits. It wasn't that at all.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,181,[]

"When he'd wandered away, carrying the egg basket in both hands, Tiffany turned out some butter onto the marble slab and picked up the paddles to pat it into, well, a pat of butter.

"'When you're Baron you'll be good at it, I expect?' said Tiffany, turning the butter around. 'Fair and generous and decent? You'll pay good wages and look after the old people?

"'Because I'll be there, you see. You'll look up and see my eye on you. I'll be there on the edge of the crowd. All the time.

"'Aye,' said Tiffany. 'So we understand one another. Isn't that nice? And now, if you don't mind, I've got to finish this and make a start on some cheese.'",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,246,['Tiffany']

"'Good,' said Tiffany. Today I'm making cheese. Tomorrow I may do something else. And in a while, maybe, I won't be here and you'll wonder: Where is she? But part of me will always be here, always.

"'Ach, no, mistress,' said Not-as-big-as-Medium-Sized-Jock-but-bigger-than-Wee-Jock-Jock nervously. Then he grinned.

"'That's grand!' said the pictsie. 'The lads were a bit worried, ye ken. I'll run up an' tell them.' He lowered his voice.

"She paused, put the paddles down, and with the tip of a very clean finger, drew a curved line in the surface, with another curved line just touching it, so that together they looked like a wave.

"The painting that Tiffany 'enters' in this book really exists. It's called The Fairy Fellers' Master-Stroke, by Richard Dadd, and is in the Tate Gallery in London. It is only about 21 inches by 15 inches. It took the artist nine years to complete, in the middle of the nineteenth century. I cannot think of a more famous 'fairy' painting. It is, indeed, very strange. Summer heat leaks out of it.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,280,['Richard Dadd']
"What people 'know' about Richard Dadd is that 'he went mad, killed his father, was locked up in a lunatic asylum for the rest of his life and painted a weird picture'. Crudely, that's all true, but it's a dreadful summary of the life of a skilled and talented artist who developed a serious mental illness.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,281,['Richard Dadd']
"A Nac Mac Feegle does not appear anywhere in the painting, but I suppose it's always possible that one was removed for making an obscene gesture. It's the sort of thing they'd do.",13_The Wee Free Men,13,Chapter 14Small Like Oak Trees,282,[]

Even the common people of the city had a keen eye for works like Caravati's Three Large Pink Women and One Piece of Gauze or Mauvaise's Man with Big Figleaf and, besides, a city with a history the length of Ankh-Morpork's accumulated all kinds of artistic debris, and in order to prevent congestion in the streets it needed some sort of civic attic in which to store it. And thus, at little more cost than a few miles of plush red rope and a few old men in uniform to give directions to Three Large Pink Women and One Piece of Gauze, the Royal Art Museum was born.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",76,[]
"Lobsang and Susan hurried through the silent halls. As with Fidgett's, it was hard to know if time had stopped here. Its passage was barely perceptible in any case. The monks at Oi Dong considered it a valuable resource.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",77,"['Lobsang', 'Susan', 'Fidgett', 'Oi Dong']"
"Susan stopped and turned to look up at a huge, gilt-framed picture that occupied one whole wall of a lengthy corridor, and said, quietly: Oh",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",78,['Susan']
"Lobsang looked at the flaking, uncleaned paint and the yellow-brown varnish. The colours had faded to a dozen shades of mud, but something violent and evil shone through.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",81,['Lobsang']
"No, it was an ancient city in Klatch, thousands of years ago, said Susan. But Grandfather did say that men made it Hell. Blitzt went mad when he painted it.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",83,"['Susan', 'Blitzt']"
"Susan grabbed his hand. Not exactly, she said. They always consult! There have to be three of them to do that! And they'll be back, so come on!",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",93,['Susan']
"There were grey figures at the far end. The pair ran on, past dust-encrusted tapestries, and into another huge, ancient room.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",95,[]
"The galleries were several storeys high. On the first floor, visitors could look down on to the floor below. And, in the room below, the Auditors were very busy.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",102,[]
"Miss Tangerine was annoyed. Her body kept making strange demands of her, and the work with which she had been entrusted was going so very badly.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",105,['Tangerine']
"The frame of what once had been Sir Robert Cuspidors Waggon Stuck In River was leaning against a wall in front of her. It was empty. The bare canvas was neatly rolled beside it. In front of the frame, carefully heaped in order of size, were piles of pigment.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",106,['Robert Cuspidors Waggon']
"The other Auditors in the gallery, clustered industriously in front of what had once been a painting and in fact still was, insofar as every single molecule was still present in the room, glanced up and then bent again to their tasks.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",113,[]
"Miss Tangerine was getting even angrier because she couldn't work out why she was angry. One reason was probably that, when he gave her this task, Mr White had looked at her in a funny way. Being looked at was an unfamiliar experience for an Auditor in any caseno Auditor bothered to look at another Auditor very often because all Auditors looked the sameand neither were they used to the idea that you could say things with your face. Or even have a face. Or have a body that reacted in strange ways to the expression on another face belonging to, in this case, Mr White. When he looked at her like that she felt a terrible urge to claw his face off.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",114,"['Tangerine', 'White', 'White']"
Which made absolutely no sense at all. No Auditor should feel like that about another Auditor. No Auditor should feel like that about anything. No Auditor should feel.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",115,[]
"She felt livid. They'd all lost so many powers. It was ridiculous to have to communicate by flapping bits of your skin, and as for the tongue Yuerkkk",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",116,[]
"As far as she knew, in the whole life of the universe, no Auditor had ever experienced the sensation of yuerkkk. This wretched body was full of opportunities for yuerkkk. She could leave it at any time and yet, and yet part of her didn't want to. There was this horrible desire, second by second, to hang on.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",117,[]
And she felt hungry. And that also made no sense. The stomach was a bag for digesting food. It wasn't supposed to issue commands. The Auditors could survive quite well by exchanging molecules with their surroundings and making use of any local source of energy. That was a fact.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",118,[]
"Try telling that to the stomach. She could feel it. It was sitting there, grumbling. She was being harassed by her internal organs. Why the why the.. why had they copied internal organs? Yuerkkk.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",119,[]
"But the words didn't work for Miss Tangerine. They just didn't have the same force that they used to. There had to be something worse. Ah, yes",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",123,['Tangerine']
"Organs! she shouted, pleased to have found it at last. And what are all you organs looking at? she added. Get on with it!",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",124,[]
"That's the Auditors for you, said Susan. They think that's how you find out about things. You know, I loathe them. I really do.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",126,['Susan']
"Lobsang glanced sideways at her. The monastry was not a single-sex institution. That is to say, it was, but corporately it had never thought of itself like that because the possibility of females working there had never crossed even minds capable of thinking of sixteen dimensions. But the Thieves' Guild had recognized that girls were at least as good as boys in all areas of thievinghe had, for example, fond memories of his classmate Steff, who could steal the small change out of your back pocket and climb better than an Assassin. He was at home around girls. But Susan scared the life out of him. It was as if some secret place inside her boiled with wrath, and with the Auditors she let it out.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",127,"['Lobsang', 'Steff', 'Susan']"
"He remembered her hitting that one with the wrench. There had been just a faint frown of concentration, as if she was making certain the job was done properly.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",128,[]
"Look at them, continued Susan. Only an Auditor would take a picture apart to see what made it a work of art.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",130,['Susan']
"Man with Huge Figleaf said Susan absently, her eyes still intent on the grey figures. They'd dismantle a clock to search for the tick.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",132,['Susan']
"I know what I like, said Susan, still staring at the busy grey figures. And right now I'd like quite a lot of weaponry.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",136,['Susan']
"The bastards get into your head if you let them, said Susan, not moving. When you find yourself thinking There ought to be a law or I don't make the rules, after all or",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",138,['Susan']
"I really think we should leave, said Lobsang carefully. And I think this because there are some of them coming up the stairs.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",139,['Lobsang']
"They ran through the next arch and into a gallery of pottery, turning to look only when they reached the far end. Three Auditors were following them. They weren't running, but there was something about their synchronized step that had a horrible we'll-keep-on-coming quality.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",141,[]
"No! said Lobsang proudly, and then realized she'd taken this the wrong way. You see, I've been taught to fight without",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",147,['Lobsang']
"Susan had found a sword, part of a display of Agatean armour. It had been blunted by disuse, but anger flared along the blade.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",150,['Susan']
"No. They always catch up. I don't know if we can kill them here, but we can make them wish we could. You still haven't got a weapon?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",152,[]
"They're human-shaped, said Susan over her shoulder. Human bodies. Perfect copies. Human bodies have had thousands and thousands of years of not wanting to be cut in half. That sort of leaks into the brain, don't you think?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",159,['Susan']
And then the Auditors were circling and moving in. Of course they would all attack at once. No one would want to be first.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",160,[]
"He'd enjoyed the fighting, back in the training dojos. Of course, everyone was padded, and no one was actually trying to kill you, and that helped. But Lobsang had done well because he was good at slicing. He could always find that extra edge. And if you had that edge, you didn't need quite so much skill.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",162,['Lobsang']
"He adopted a mixture of sna-fu and okidoki and anything that worked, because you were dead if you treated a real fight like the dojo. The grey men were no contest, in any case. They just attempted to grab and hug. A granny would have been able to fend them off.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",164,['okidoki']
"He sent two reeling and turned to the third, which was trying to grab him around the neck. He broke the hold, spun around ready to chop, and hesitated.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",165,[]
"The head in front of him was parted from its former body in a shower not of blood but of coloured, floating dust. The body evaporated, became very briefly a grey-robed shape in the air, and vanished.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",168,[]
"It was not! But it was the last one. Now let's go, before the rest get here. She nodded at a second group of Auditors that were watching them very carefully from the end of the hall.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",172,[]
"The next gallery was full of stuffed animals. There'd been a vogue for it a few centuries before. These weren't the sad old hunting-trophy bears or geriatric tigers whose claws had faced a man armed with nothing more than five crossbows, twenty loaders and a hundred beaters. Some of these animals were arranged in groups. Quite small groups, of quite small animals.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",178,[]
"There were frogs, seated around a tiny dining table. There were dogs, dressed in hunting jackets, in pursuit of a fox wearing a cap with feathers in it. There was a monkey playing a banjo.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",179,[]
"Oh, no, it's an entire band, said Susan in tones of horrified astonishment. And just look at the little kittens dancing",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",180,['Susan']
"Lobsang paused at the foot of a staircase, half hidden behind a luckless elephant. A red rope, now hard as a bar, suggested that this wasn't part of the public museum. There was an added hint in the shape of a notice saying: Absolutely No Admittance.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",185,['Lobsang']
"Look at the sign, will you? said Susan. Don't see what you expect to see, see what's in front of you!",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",191,['Susan']
"Hmm. Interesting, certainly, said Susan. Which way do you think we should go? I don't think it'll take them too long to decide to follow us.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",194,['Susan']
"Eventually. But they'll have a terrible feeling that they ought not to. They obey rules. They are the rules, in a way.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",201,[]
"We can only hope so. Let's move, said Susan. They crept on, weaving through the maze of spaces between the crates, and past a sign saying:",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",218,['Susan']
"She reached down and picked up the soft, sticky mess. And as she rose, she saw the Auditor come round the corner.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",230,[]
"It was wild-eyed and frantic. It focused on the pair of them with difficulty, as if trying to remember who and what they were. But it was holding a sword, and holding it correctly.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",231,[]
A figure rose up behind it. One hand grabbed it by the hair and jerked its head back. The other was thrust over its open mouth.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",232,[]
"For a moment the last few handfuls tried to form, in the air, the shape of a small cowled figure. Then it, too, was dragged apart, with a faint scream that was heard via the hairs on the back of the neck.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",235,[]
"The figure was silent. This might have been because thick cloth covered its nose and mouth. Heavy gloves encased its hands, too. And this was odd, because most of the rest of it was wearing a sequinned evening gown. And a mink stole. And a knapsack. And a huge picture hat with enough feathers to make three rare species totally extinct.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",238,[]
"The figure rummaged in the knapsack, and then thrust out a piece of dark brown paper, as if proffering holy writ. Lobsang took it with care.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",239,['Lobsang']
Susan opened her hand and looked at the crushed Strawberry Whirl she had picked up. She gave the figure a careful look.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",241,['Susan']
"Please! You have nothing to fear from me, said the muffled voice through the bandages. I'm down to the ones with the nuts in now, and they don't melt very quickly.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",243,[]
"People were living in the attic. There was a whole family up there. Susan wondered if their presence was official or unofficial or one of those in-between states that were so common in Ankh-Morpork, where there was always a chronic housing shortage. So much of the city's life took place on the street because there was no room for it inside. Whole families were raised in shifts, so that the bed could be used for twenty-four hours a day. By the look of it, the caretakers and men who knew the way to Caravati's Three Large Pink Women and One Piece of Gauze had moved their families in to the rambling attics.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",250,['Susan']
"The rescuer had simply moved in on top of them. A family, or at least one shift of it, was seated on benches around a table. frozen in timelessness. Lady LeJean removed her hat, hung it on the mother and shook out her hair. Then she unwrapped the heavy bandages from her nose and mouth.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",251,['Lady LeJean']
"We are relatively safe here, she said. They are mostly in the main streets. Good day. My name is Myria LeJean. I know who you are, Susan Sto Helit. I do not know the young man, which surprises me. I take it you are here to destroy the clock?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",252,"['Myria LeJean', 'Susan Sto Helit']"
"Hold on, hold on, said Susan. This makes no sense. Auditors hate everything about life. And you are an Auditor, aren't you?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",254,['Susan']
"I have no idea what I am, sighed Lady LeJean. But right now I know that I am everything an Auditor should not be. We they we have to be stopped!",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",255,['Lady LeJean']
"A dry biscuit almost killed me, said her ladyship. Susan, can you imagine what it is like to experience taste for the first time? We built our bodies well. Oh, yes. Lots of tastebuds. Water is like wine. But chocolate even the mind stops. There is nothing but the taste. She sighed. I imagine it is a wonderful way to die.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",259,['Susan']
"The bandages and the gloves, said Lady LeJean. Even then, it is all I can do not to give in. Oh, where are my manners? Do sit down. Pull up a small child.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",261,['Lady LeJean']
"Ah. I have so much to learn. There is there is so much context to being human, I am afraid. You, sir, can you stop the clock?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",267,[]
"And it was a lie. But he wasn't ready for the truth. By the look on his face, he wasn't even ready for the lie.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",277,[]
"Twins, said Mrs Ogg. She picked up the brandy glass, looked at it, and put it down. There wasn't one. There was twins. Two boys. But",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",278,['Mrs Ogg']
"She turned on Susan a glare like a thermic lance. You'll be thinking, this is an old biddy of a midwife, she said. You'll be thinking, what does she know?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",279,['Susan']
"Good answer! Part of us thinks all kinds of things, said Mrs Ogg. Part of me is thinking, who's this haughty little miss who talks to me as if I was a kiddie of five? But most of me is thinking: she's got a heap of troubles of her own and has seen plenty of things a human shouldn't have to see. Mind you, part of me says: so have I. Seeing things a human shouldn't have to see makes us human. Well, miss if you've any sense, part of you is thinking, there's a witch in front of me who's seen my granddad many times, when she's sat by a sickbed that's suddenly become a deathbed, and if she's ready to spit in his eye when the time comes then she could probably bother me considerably right now if she puts her mind to it. Understand? Let's all keep our parts to ourselves, and suddenly she gave Susan a wink, as the High Priest said to the actress.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",282,"['Mrs Ogg', 'Susan']"
"Right, said Mrs Ogg. So twins well, it was her first time, and human wasn't exactly a familiar shape with her, I mean, you can't do what comes naturally when you ain't exactly natural and twins ain't quite the right word",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",284,['Mrs Ogg']
"Yes. But he's asleep. I think the clock upset his mind, and also he was hit in the fight. He says things in his sleep.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",292,[]
"The last thing I heard him say before I came to find you was, We're so close. Any passage might do, said her ladyship. She looked from one to the other. Have I said the wrong thing?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",294,[]
"I said that, said Lobsang. Just after we came up the stairs. He glared at Susan. Twins, right? I've heard about this sort of thing! What one thinks the other thinks too?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",296,"['Lobsang', 'Susan']"
"Jeremy was lying on a bed, although it was no softer than anything else in the timeless world. Lobsang stopped, and stared.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",300,"['Jeremy', 'Lobsang']"
"My grandfather takes, er, an interest in this sort of thing. I found out some more by myself, too, she said.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",308,[]
"The signs upset them, said her ladyship. They tend to keep away. I shall we say took care of the ones who followed you.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",311,[]
"A wind whipped around the room, and the light changed. Shadows formed on Susan's face. A faint blue light outlined her.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",317,['Susan']
"There is a process called death, and there is a person called Death, said Susan. That is how it works. And I am Death's granddaughter. Am I going too fast for you?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",320,"['Death', 'Susan']"
"My parents were human. There's more than one kind of genetics. Susan paused. You look human, too. Human is a very popular look in these parts. You'd be amazed.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",322,['Susan']
"Take War, now, said Susan, backing away from the point. Big man, hearty laugh, tends to fart after meals. As human as the next man, you say. But the next man is Death. He's human-shaped, too. And that's because humans invented the idea of of of ideas, and they think in human shapes",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",327,['Susan']
"I could take you to the midwife, said Susan. Your father found the best there's ever been. She delivered you. Your mother was Time.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",331,['Susan']
"It was easier for me, said Susan. When I was very small my parents used to let me visit my grandfather. I thought every grandfather had a long black robe and rode a pale horse. And then they decided that maybe that wasn't the right environment for a child. They were worried about how I was going to grow up! She laughed mirthlessly. I had a very strange education, you know? Maths, logic, that sort of thing. And then, when I was a bit younger than you, a rat turned up in my room and suddenly everything I thought I knew was wrong.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",333,['Susan']
"You had to live in the world. Otherwise, how could you learn to be human? said Susan, as kindly as she could.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",335,['Susan']
"I had to lead up to it, said Susan. It's one of those things you have to get hold of a bit at a time, I'm afraid. He's not your brother. He's you.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",339,['Susan']
"And there I was, and there she was, said Mrs Ogg, and out the baby came, no problem there, but that's always a tryin' moment for the new mum, and there was she paused, her eyes peering through the windows of memory, like like a feelin' that the world had stuttered, and I was holdin' the baby and I looked down and there was me deliverin' a baby, and I looked at me, and I looked at me, and I remember saying, This is a fine to-do, Mrs Ogg, and she, who was me, said, You never said a truer word, Mrs Ogg, and then it all went strange and there I was, just one of me, holdin' two babies.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",342,"['Mrs Ogg', 'Mrs Ogg', 'Mrs Ogg']"
"You could call them twins, yes, I s'pose you could, said Mrs Ogg. But I always thought that twins is two little souls born once, not one born twice.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",344,['Mrs Ogg']
"So I said to the man, I said, What now? and he said, Is that any business of yours? and I said he could be damn sure it was my business and he could look me in the eye and I'd speak my mind to anyone. But I was thinking, you're in trouble now, my girl, 'cos it'd all gone myffic.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",346,[]
"Yep. With extra myff. And you can get into big trouble, with myffic. But the man just smiled and said that he must be brought up human until he's of age and I thought, yep, it's gone myffic all right. I could see he hadn't got a clue about what to do next and it was all going to be down to me.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",348,[]
"Mrs Ogg took a suck at her pipe and her eyes twinkled at Susan through the smoke. I don't know how much experience you have with this sort of thing, my girl, but sometimes when the high and mighty make big plans they don't always think about the fine detail, right?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",349,"['Mrs Ogg', 'Susan']"
"Yes. I'm a fine detail, Susan thought. One day Death took it into his skull to adopt a motherless child, and I'm a fine detail. She nodded.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",350,['Susan']
"I thought, how does this go, in a myffic kind of way? Mrs Ogg went on. I mean, technic'ly I could see we're in that area where the prince gets brought up as a swineherd until he manifests his destiny, but there's not that many swineherding jobs around these days, and poking hogs with a stick is not all it's cracked up to be, believe you me. So I said, well, I'd heard the Guilds down in the big cities took in foundlings out of charity, and looked after them well enough, and there's many well set-up men and women who started life that way. There's no shame in it, plus, if the destiny doesn't manifest as per schedule, he'd have set his hands to a good trade, which would be a consolation. Whereas swineherding 's just swineherding. You're giving me a stern look, miss.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",351,['Mrs Ogg']
"Someone has to make 'em, said Mrs Ogg sharply. Besides, I've been around for some time and I've noticed that them as has it in them to shine will shine through six layers of muck, whereas those who ain't shiny won't shine however much you buff 'em. You may think otherwise, but it was me standing there.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",353,"['Mrs Ogg', 'buff']"
"Eventually she went on: And that was it. I would have stayed, of course, because there wasn't so much as a crib in the place, but the man took me aside and said thank you and that it was time to go. And why would I argue? There was love there. It was in the air. But I won't say that I don't sometimes wonder how it all turned out. I really do.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",355,[]
"There were differences, Susan had to admit. Two different lives had indeed burned their unique tracks on the faces. And the selves had been born a second or so apart, and a lot of the universe can change in a second.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",356,['Susan']
"Think of identical twins, she told herself. But they are two different selves occupying bodies that, at least, start out identical. They don't start out as identical selves.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",357,[]
"It's more complicated than that, I think. Susan picked up a limp hand and gently pinched the web of skin between thumb and forefinger.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",365,['Susan']
"We at least should not stay here, said Lady LeJean. I know my kind. They will have been discussing what to do. The signs will not hold them for ever. And I have run out of soft centres.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",372,['Lady LeJean']
"Susan wondered later if this was what it would be like at the heart of a star. It wouldn't be yellow, you wouldn't see fire, there would just be the searing whiteness of every overloaded sense screaming all at once.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",376,['Susan']
"It faded, gradually, into a mist. The walls of the room appeared, but she could see through them.

In each one another Susan was turning to look at her.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",377,['Susan']
"Susan was sensible. It was, she knew, a major character flaw. It did not make you popular, or cheerful, andthis seemed to her to be the most unfair bitit didn't even make you right. But it did make you definite, and she was definite that what was happening around her was not, in any accepted sense, real.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",379,['Susan']
"That was not in itself a problem. Most of the things humans busied themselves with weren't real, either. But sometimes the mind of the most sensible person encountered something so big, so complex, so alien to all understanding, that it told itself little stories about it instead. Then, when it felt it understood the story, it felt it understood the huge incomprehensible thing. And this, Susan knew, was her mind telling itself a story.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",380,['Susan']

"It turned out to be nothing more than a large box the size of a small room, which hung from a web of ropes and pulleys in the ceiling. It had been installed recently, by the look of it, to move the large works of art around. Sliding doors occupied most of one wall.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",392,[]
"There are capstans in the cellar for winching it up, said Lady LeJean. Downward journeys are slowed safely because of a mechanism by which the weight of the descending elevator causes water to be pumped up into rainwater cisterns on the roof, which in turn can be released back into a hollow counterweight that assists in the elevation of heavier items of",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",393,['Lady LeJean']

"Until now Auditors had learned by counting. Sooner or later, everything came down to numbers. If you knew all the numbers, you knew everything. Often the later was a lot later, but that did not matter because for an Auditor time was just another number. But a brain, a few soggy pounds of gristle, counted numbers so fast that they stopped being numbers at all. She'd been astonished at how easily it could direct a hand to catch a ball in the air, calculating future positions of hand and ball without her even being aware of it.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",398,[]
"At the moment she was trying to explain to other Auditors that not feeding an elephant when there was no elephant not to feed was not in fact impossible. Miss Tangerine was one of the faster-learning Auditors and had already formulated a group of things, events and situations that she categorized as bloody stupid. Things that were bloody stupid could be dismissed.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",400,['Tangerine']

"Susan turned. Lady LeJean's hat and dress had become even more tattered, and she was shedding sequins. And then there was the matter of the face. An exquisite mask on a bone structure like fine china had been made up by a clown. Probably a blind clown. And one who was wearing boxing gloves. In a fog. Lady LeJean looked at the world through panda eyes and her lipstick touched her mouth only by accident.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",415,"['Susan', 'Lady LeJean', 'Lady LeJean']"

The Auditors gathered. They had been learning. Many of them had acquired weapons. And a number of them had taken care not to communicate to the others that gripping something offensive in the hand seemed a very natural thing to do. It spoke to something right down in the back of the brain.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",422,[]

"She wasn't certain how this would work. If she fell but would she fall? There was no time to fall. She had her own personal time. In theory, if anything so definite as a theory existed in a case like this, that meant she could just drift down to the ground. But the time to test a theory like that was when you had no other choice. A theory was just an idea, but a drainpipe was a fact.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",428,[]
"Er Susan blanched at unfolding the complex laws of lingerie to someone who wasn't even, she felt, anybody. To anyone likely to find out, yes, she finished. It would take too long to explain.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",445,['Susan']
"Lady LeJean sighed. All of it does, she said. Even clothing. Skin-substitutes to preserve body heat? So simple. So easy to say. But there are so many rules and exceptions, impossible to understand.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",446,['Lady LeJean']

"Vanity, vanity, thought Lu-Tze, as the milk cart rattled through the silent city. Ronnie would have been like a god, and people of that stripe don't like hiding. Not really hiding.

"Susan had been unusually inexact. To call Wienrich and Boettcher chocolate makers was like calling Leonard of Quirm a decent painter who also tinkered with things, or Death not someone you'd want to meet every day. It was accurate, but it didn't tell the whole story.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",476,"['Susan', 'Wienrich', 'Boettcher', 'Leonard']"
"For one thing, they didn't make, they created. There's an important difference.[17. Up to ten dollars a pound, usually.] And, while their select little shop sold the results, it didn't do anything so crass as to fill the window with them. That would suggest well, over-eagerness. Generally, W&B had a display of silk and velvet drapes with, on a small stand, perhaps one of their special pralines or no more than three of their renowned frosted caramels. There was no price tag. If you had to ask the price of W&B's chocolates, you couldn't afford them. And if you'd tasted one, and still couldn't afford them, you'd save and scrimp and rob and sell elderly members of your family for just one more of those mouthfuls that fell in love with your tongue and turned your soul to whipped cream.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",477,[]
"Wienrich and Boettcher were, naturally, foreigners, and according to Ankh-Morpork's Guild of Confectioners they did not understand the peculiarities of the city's tastebuds.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",479,"['Wienrich', 'Boettcher']"
"Ankh-Morpork people, said the Guild, were hearty, no-nonsense folk who did not want chocolate that was stuffed with cocoa liquor, and were certainly not like effete la-di-dah foreigners who wanted cream in everything. In fact they actually preferred chocolate made mostly from milk, sugar, suet, hooves, lips, miscellaneous squeezings, rat droppings, plaster, flies, tallow, bits of tree, hair, lint, spiders and powdered cocoa husks. This meant that according to the food standards of the great chocolate centres in Borogravia and Quirm, Ankh-Morpork chocolate was formally classed as cheese and only escaped, through being the wrong colour, being defined as tile grout.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",480,[]
Susan allowed herself one of their cheaper boxes per month. And she could easily stop at the first layer if she wanted to.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",481,['Susan']

"We I know about will-power. The body craves the chocolate but the mind does not. At least, so I tell myself. And it must be true! The mind can overrule the body! Otherwise, what is it for?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",497,[]
"Oh, she said. Uh I can detect sugar, milk, butter, cream, vanilla, hazelnuts, almonds, walnuts, raisins, orange peel, various liqueurs, citrus pectin, strawberries, raspberries, essence of violets, cherries, pineapples, pistachios, oranges, limes, lemons, coffee, cocoa",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",502,[]

"In fact, it seemed to Susan, as she walked past the vats and counters, that chocolate lost some of its attraction when you saw it like this. It was the difference between seeing the little heaps of pigment and seeing the whole picture. She selected a syringe that seemed designed to do something intensely personal to female elephants, athough she decided that here it was probably used for doing the wiggly bits of decoration.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",509,['Susan']
"She stared around at the trays and trays of fondant cremes, marzipans and caramels. Oh, and here was an entire table of Soul Cake eggs.

Out of the corner of her eye she saw movement. One of the statue-like workers bent over her tray of Praline Dreams was shifting almost imperceptibly.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",512,[]
"She turned and saw a vaguely human figure hovering beside her. It was featureless and as transparent as mist, but in her head it said, I'm stronger. You are my anchor, my link to this world.

Susan turned and thrust the icing syringe into the arms of the groaning Myria. Grab that. And make some kind of of sling or something.

"Oh, gods, there was no alternative. The poor thing needed some kind of morale boost. Please, Myria? And that's a stupid name! You're not many, you're one. Okay? Just be yourself. Unity that'd be a good name.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",516,['Myria']

Fire? Fire? Just a demi-god! Some little tea-leaf pinches the flame from the gods and suddenly he's immortal? You call that training and experience?

"Technically, yes, said Lu-Tze. But he's an abbot. And brainy? He thinks such big thoughts he needs a second lifetime just to finish them off! Let a lot of peasants fear famine, I say, but someone like you should aim for quality. And you look at the cities, now. Back in the old days there were just heaps of mud bricks with names like Ur and Uh and Ugg. These days there's millions of people living in cities. Very, very complicated cities.

"The return journey was a lot swifter but, when the world existed again, she was falling into water. It was brown, muddy and stank of dead plants. Susan surfaced, fighting against the drag of her skirts, and trod water while she tried to get her bearings.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1052,['Susan']
"The sun was nailed to the sky, the air was heavy and humid, and a pair of nostrils was watching her from a few feet away.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1053,[]
"Susan had been brought up to be practical and that meant swimming lessons. The Quirm College for Young Ladies had been very advanced in that respect, and its teachers took the view that a girl who couldn't swim two lengths of the pool with her clothes on wasn't making an effort. To their credit, she'd left knowing four swimming strokes and several life-saving techniques, and was entirely at home in the water. She also knew what to do if you were sharing the same stretch of water with a hippopotamus, which was to find another stretch of water. Hippos only look big and cuddly from a distance. Close up, they just look big.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1054,['Susan']
"Susan summoned up all the inherited powers of the deathly voice plus the terrible authority of the schoolroom, and yelled, GO AWAY!",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1055,['Susan']
"The creature floundered madly in its effort to turn round, and Susan struck out for the shore. It was an unsure shore, the water becoming land in a tangle of sandbanks, sucking black muck, rotted tree roots and swamp. Insects swirled around and",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1056,['Susan']
"The hippo had come as a shock. She'd never realized one mouth could hold so much bad breath, or be so big and deep.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1062,[]

"All right, all right, I know, said Susan darkly. She held out her hand and concentrated. An image of Lu-Tze's extremely heavy lifetimer appeared, and gathered weight.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1064,"['Susan darkly', ""Lu-Tze's""]"
"Lu-Tze, when they found him, was looking calmly up at an enormous mammoth. Under its huge hairy brow its eyes were squinting with the effort both of seeing him and of getting all three of its brain cells lined up so that it could decide whether to trample on him or gouge him out of the frost-bound landscape. One brain cell was saying gouge, one was going for trample but the third had wandered off and was thinking about as much sex as possible.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1067,['Lu-Tze']
"Over by that snowdrift, said Lu-Tze, indicating with his thumb while still trying to outstare a pair of eyes five feet apart. When this turned up she screamed and twisted her ankle. Look, you can see I've made it nervous",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1073,['Lu-Tze']
"Life is full of surprises, said Susan, but the sight of the creature's distress made her hesitate. All right, the thing was one of them, one that was merely wearingWell, at least had started out merely wearing a body as a kind of coat, but now After all, you could say that about everyone, couldn't you?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1078,['Susan']
"Susan had even wondered if the human soul without the anchor of a body would end up, eventually, as something like an Auditor. Which, to be fair, meant that Unity, who was getting more firmly wrapped in flesh by the minute, was something like a human. And that was a pretty good definition of Lobsang and, if it came to it, Susan as well. Who knew where humanity began and where it finished?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1079,"['Susan', 'Lobsang', 'Susan']"
"There was a lighthouse, though. The valley of Oi Dong held on to the ever-repeating day. In the hall almost all of the giant cylinders stood silent, all time run out. Some had split. Some had melted. Some had exploded. Some had simply vanished. But one still turned.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1082,[]

"Handisides sprang to his feet. It's been terrible, Sweeper! Everyone's up in the Mandala Hall! It's worse than the Great Crash! There's bits of history everywhere and we've lost half the spinners! We'll never be able to put it all",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1089,[]
"Now, now, you look like a man who's had a busy day, said Lu-Tze kindly. Not got a lot of sleep, eh? Tell you what, I'll take care of this. You go and get a bit of shut-eye, okay?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1090,['Lu-Tze']
"And now I'm back, smiled Lu-Tze, patting him on the shoulder. There's still that little alcove round the corner where you repair the smaller spinners? And there's still those unofficial bunks for when it's the night shift and you only need a couple of lads to keep their eye on things?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1092,['Lu-Tze']
"You get along, then, said Lu-Tze. He watched the man's retreating back and added, quietly, and if you wake up you might turn out to be the luckiest idiot that ever there was. Well, wonder boy? What next?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1094,['Lu-Tze']

"Imagine that there is a jigsaw, all in pieces. But I am very good at spotting edges and shapes. Very good. And all the pieces are moving. But because they were once linked, they have by their very nature a memory of that link. Their shape is the memory. Once a few are in the right position, the rest will be easier. Oh, and imagine that all the bits are scattered across the whole of eventuality, and mixing randomly with pieces from other histories. Can you grasp all that?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1107,[]
"Good. Everything I have just said is nonsense. It bears no resemblance to the truth of the matter in any way at all. But it is a lie that you can understand, I think. And then, afterwards",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1109,[]
"You need power to stay human? said Susan. She hadn't been aware of the rise of her heart, but now it was sinking.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1112,['Susan']
Yes. Even trying to think in a mere four dimensions is a terrible effort. I'm sorry. Even to hold in my mind the concept of something called now is hard. You thought I was mostly human. I'm mostly not. He sighed. If only I could tell you what everything looks like to me it's so beautiful.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1113,[]

"It was like looking at a clock in pieces, with every wheel and spring carefully laid out in the dark in front of him. Dismantled, controllable, every part of it understood but a number of small but important things had gone ping into the corners of a very large room. If you were really good, then you could work out where they'd landed.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1115,[]

"Good trick! Lu-Tze shouted to Susan's ear, above the thunder. Feeding time into the spinners themselves! Theoretically possible, but we never managed to do it!",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1120,"['Lu-Tze', 'Susan']"
Yeah! Snatch the extra time out of bits of history that are too far ahead and shove it into the bits that have fallen behind!,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1122,[]
"Can't do it! Losses! Lu-Tze snapped his fingers, trying to explain time dynamics to a non-initiate. Friction! Divergence! All sorts of stuff! You can't create time on the spinners, you can only move it around",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1126,['Lu-Tze']
"There was a sudden bright blue glow around Lobsang. It flickered over the board, and then snapped across the air to form arcs of light leading to all the Procrastinators. It crawled between the carved symbols and clung to them in a thickening layer, like cotton winding on a reel.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1127,[]
"The spinners wound up to their working speed and then went faster, under the lash of the light. It poured across the cavern in a solid, unending stream.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1130,[]

"Steam built up then, and there was a smell of burning butter. There was no time for anything but to run from the wells to the nearest spitting bearing and back, and there was not enough time even for that.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1135,[]
"The spinners turned back and forth. There was no need for the jumpers now. The crystal rods that had survived the crash hung uselessly from their hooks as time arced overhead from one Procrastinator to another, showing up as red or blue glows in the air. It was a sight to frighten the knoptas off any trained spinnerdriver, Lu-Tze knew. It looked like a cascade running wild, but there was some control in there, some huge pattern being woven.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1136,['Lu-Tze']
"Bearings squealed. Butter bubbled. The bases of some spinners were smoking. But things held. They're being held, Lu-Tze thought. He looked up at the registers. The boards slammed back and forth, sending lines of red or blue or bare wood across the wall of the cavern. There was a pall of white smoke around them as their own wooden bearings gently charred.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1137,['Lu-Tze']
"On the podium, Lobsang was wrapped in the glow. The bobbins were not being moved any more. What was going on now was on some other level, which didn't need the intervention of crude mechanisms.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1139,['Lobsang']
"Lion tamer, Lu-Tze thought. He starts off needing chairs and whips but one day, if he's really good, he can go into the cage and do the show using nothing more than eye and voice. But only if he's really good, and you'll know if he's really good because he'll come out of the cage again",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1140,['Lu-Tze']
"The three ran towards the end of the cavern, where the smaller Procrastinators were still whirling, but the halt was already speeding down the rows.

"Is it all over? said Unity, wiping the sweat from her face with her dress and leaving a trail of sequins.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1147,[]
"Bars of green light leapt from spinner to spinner and hung in the air as rigid as steel. They flickered on and off between the columns, filling the air with thunderclaps. Patterns of switching snapped back and forth across the cavern.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1151,[]
"The tempo increased. The thunderclaps became one long roll of overpowering sound. The bars brightened, expanded and then the air was all one brilliant light",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1152,[]

"Well, he's partly human, said the sweeper. They turned to the podium, and it was empty. Susan was not surprised. He'd be weak now, of course. Of course, something like this would take it out of anyone. Of course, he'd need to rest. Of course.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1162,['Susan']
"The reassuring rumble of the Procrastinators now filled the cave. Lu-Tze could feel the time flows in the air. It was invigorating, like the smell of the sea. I ought to spend more time down here, he thought.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1165,['Lu-Tze']
"And now, may I suggest you ladies leave by the back way? said Lu-Tze. People are going to come running down here in a minute and it's all going to get very excitable. Probably best if you aren't around.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1168,['Lu-Tze']
"Susan and Unity stepped out of a door in the rock and took the path that led through rhododendron groves out of the valley. The sun was touching the horizon and the air was warm, although there were snowfields quite close by.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1172,['Susan']

"I am insane. I know this. But the first time it happened to me I found such horror that I cannot express it. Can you imagine what it is like? For an intellect a billion years old, in a body which is an ape on the back of a rat that grew out of a lizard? Can you imagine what comes out of the dark places, uncontrolled?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1191,[]
"Susan thought about this. Millions and millions of years of thinking precise, logical thoughtsand then humanity's murky past drops all its terrors on you in one go. She could almost feel sorry for them. Almost.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1194,['Susan']
"No. I think I must be different. It is a terrible thing to be different, Susan. Did you have romantic hopes in connection with the boy?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1196,['Susan']
The question came out of nowhere and there was no defence. Unity's face showed nothing but a kind of nervous concern.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1197,[]

"Susan felt a stab of guilt. It wasn't Unity's fault, after all. People learn things as they grow up, things that never get written down. And Unity had never grown up.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1204,['Susan']
"It was, she realized later, one of those phrases like How are you? People were supposed to understand that it wasn't a real question. But Unity hadn't learned that, either.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1208,[]

"He was sitting by the side of the street, watching carefully, with his begging bowl in front of him. There were of course far more interesting and complex ways for a History Monk to avoid being noticed, but he'd adopted the begging bowl method ever since Lu-Tze had shown him that people never see anyone who wants them to give him money.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1215,['Lu-Tze']
"He'd watched the rescuers drag the bodies out of the house. Initially they'd thought that one of them had been hideously mutilated in the explosion, until it had sat up and explained that it was an Igor and in very good shape for an Igor, at that. The other he'd recognized as Dr Hopkins of the Guild of Clockmakers, who was miraculously unharmed.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1216,['Dr Hopkins']
"Soto did not believe in miracles, however. He was also suspicious about the fact that the ruined house was full of oranges, that Dr Hopkins was babbling about getting sunlight out of them, and that his sparkling little abacus was telling him that something enormous had happened.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1217,"['Soto', 'Dr Hopkins']"
Soto picked up the bowl and set off through the network of alleys back to his base. He didn't bother much about concealment now; Lu-Tze's time in the city had been a process of accelerated education for many citizens of the lurking variety. The people of Ankh-Morpork knew all about Rule One.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1219,"['Soto', ""Lu-Tze's""]"
"At least, they had known until now. Three figures lurched out of the dark, and one of them swung a heavy cleaver which would have connected with Soto's head if he hadn't ducked.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1220,['Soto']
"He was used to this sort of thing, of course. There was always the occasional slow learner, but they presented no peril that a neat slice couldn't handle.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1221,[]
"He straightened up, ready to ease his way out of there, and a thick lock of black hair fell onto his shoulder, slithered down his robe and flopped onto the ground. It made barely a sound, but the expression on his face as Soto looked down and then up at his attackers made them draw back.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1222,['Soto']

"Everyone has a conditional clause in their life, some little unspoken addition to the rules like except when I really need to or unless no one is looking or, indeed, unless the first one was nougat.

"Blossom cascaded from the trees as they passed. They entered the monastery, and took the same route they'd taken once before. This brought them into the Hall of the Mandala, and the sand rose like a dog welcoming its master and spiralled in the air far below Lobsang's sandals. Lu-Tze heard the shouts of the attendants behind him.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1258,"['Blossom', 'Lu-Tze']"

"Above them, all the time, petals of cherry blossom fell like snow. At last Lu-Tze reached the high, round metal door of the Iron Dojo. The clasp of the door was fifteen feet up. No one who did not belong there was supposed to open the door of the dojo.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1260,['Lu-Tze']
"Rust spread under his fingers. Red stains spread out across the ancient metal. The door began to creak, and then to crumble.

"The abbot smiled a cherubic smile. So should we all, he said. None of us has ever seen it, I believe. None of us has ever been able to wheedle it out of him. But this is the Iron Dojo. It has rules!

"It teaches the virtues of stealth and discipline, said Lu-Tze, cracking his knuckles. Impetuosity and speed can be as dangerous to the attacker as to the attacked, as perhaps you will learn.

"Around Lobsang there was a series of snapping noises, and for a moment he thought of the old sweeper's bones. But tiny hatches all over the curved wall were swinging open. He could hear whispers as people jostled for position. And by the sound of it, there were a great many people.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1308,['Lobsang']
"Lobsang drifted closer. You cannot believe the things that I have seen since last I saw you, he said. Words cannot describe them. I have seen worlds nesting within worlds, like those dolls they carve in Uberwald. I have heard the music of the years. I know more than I can ever understand. But I do not know the Fifth Surprise. It is a trick, a conundrum a test.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1313,['Lobsang']
"The sweeper produced a cheap carnival mask. It was one of those that consisted of a fake pair of spectacles, glued above a big pink nose, and finished with a heavy black moustache.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1325,[]
"The blows came out of nowhere. They caught him in the stomach, on the back of his neck, in the small of his back and swept his legs from under him. He landed on his stomach, with Lu-Tze pinning him down in the Straddle of the Fish. The only way to get out of that was to dislocate your own shoulders.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1333,['Lu-Tze']
"I never taught it to 'em, that's why! said Lu-Tze. Promise not to harm me, would you? Thank you so very much! Submit?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1337,['Lu-Tze']
"You never told me you knew it! Lu-Tze's knees, rammed into the secret pressure points, were turning Lobsang's arms into powerless lumps of flesh.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1338,"[""Lu-Tze's""]"
"I may be old but I'm not daft! Lu-Tze shouted. You don't think I'd give away a trick like that, do you?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1339,['Lu-Tze']
"Didn't say fair on the box, lad. But you can win, you know. You could turn me into dust, just like that. How could I stop Time?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1342,[]
"Lobsang could feel parts of his body trying to shut themselves down. His shoulders were on fire. I can discarnate, he thought. Yes, I can, I could turn him to dust with a thought. And lose. I'd walk out and he'd be dead and I'd have lost.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1345,['Lobsang']
"Rule Nineteen? said Lobsang, almost pushing himself off the mat until terrible pain forced him down again. What the hell is Rule Nineteen? Yes, yes, submit, submit!",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1347,['Lobsang']
"Remember Never to Forget Rule One, said Lu-Tze. He released his grip. And always ask yourself: how come it was created in the first place, eh?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1348,['Lu-Tze']
"Lu-Tze got to his feet, and went on: But you have performed well, all things considered, and therefore as your master I have no hesitation in recommending you for the yellow robe. Besides, he lowered his voice to a whisper, everyone peeking in here has seen me beat Time and that's the sort of thing that'll look really good on my curriculum vitae, if you catch my meaning. Def'nitely give the o'l Rule One a fillip. Let me give you a hand up.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1349,['Lu-Tze']
The remains of the door were pushed aside by the hands of many monks. There was the sound of someone being hit with a rubber yak. Bikkit!,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1354,[]
"and the abbot, I believe, is ready to present you with the robe, said Lu-Tze. Don't make any comment if he dribbles on it, please.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1355,['Lu-Tze']
"It was, Lu-Tze reminisced later, an unusual ceremony. The abbot did not appear overawed, because babies generally aren't and will throw up over anyone. Besides, Lobsang might have been master of the gulfs of time, but the abbot was master of the valley, and therefore respect was a line that travelled in both directions.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1357,"['Lu-Tze', 'Lobsang']"
"Lobsang had refused it. It had been left to the chief acolyte to ask why, while the whispered current of surprise washed through the crowd.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1359,[]
"This time the current was a tsunami. It crashed over the audience. Heads turned. There were gasps of shock, and one or two nervous laughs. And, from the lines of sweepers who had been allowed to pause in their tasks to watch the event, there was a watchful, intent silence.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1363,[]
"The chief acolyte looked around, but there was no help anywhere. The other senior members of the monastery had no wish to share in the huge pink cloud of embarrassment. The abbot merely blew bubbles, and grinned the inward knowing grin of all babies everywhere.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1367,[]
"Lu-Tze stepped up behind him. Can I be of any help, your acolytility? he said, with a sort of mad keen subservience that was quite alien to his normal attitude.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1369,['Lu-Tze']
"I could fetch a nearly new robe, sir, and the lad can have my old broom if you'll sign a chitty for me to get a new one from stores, sir, said Lu-Tze, sweating helpfulness at every pore.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1371,['Lu-Tze']
He reappeared with his broom and a robe made white and thin with frequent bashings on the stones by the river. He solemnly handed them over to the chief acolyte.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1375,[]
"Very simple one, sir, said Lu-Tze, still radiating eagerness. Wording is quite loose, sir, but generally we say, This is your robe, look after it, it belongs to the monastery, sir, and then with the broom we say something like Here's your broom, treat it well, it is your friend, you will be fined if you lose it, remember they do not grow on trees, sir.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1377,['Lu-Tze']
"To the chief acolyte, still floundering in the flood of the turning tide, this was as welcome as the imminent prospect of dry land. He beamed manically.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1384,[]
"Lu-Tze held out the worn robe and the elderly broom. Broom! Robe! Do not lose them, we are not made of money! he announced.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1390,"['Lu-Tze', 'Robe']"
"They both stood up. And, er, what happens now? said the chief acolyte. He was a broken man, and he knew it. Nothing was going to be the same after this.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1396,[]
"There is so much I will not tell, said Lobsang, smiling. The abbot leaned forward and dribbled into the chief acolyte's ear.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1399,['Lobsang']
"No, said Lobsang. It is not. I suggest you all get on with your very important work, because this plaza is going to need all my attention.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1401,['Lobsang']
"There was no sound for a while but the brushing of two brooms. Then Lobsang said, I'm aware, Lu-Tze, that it is usual for an apprentice to give a small gift or token to his master when he finishes his apprenticeship.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1409,"['Lobsang', 'Lu-Tze']"
Oh dear. That is a shame. I hoped I could find something. Now Lobsang straightened up and swung his broom onto his shoulder.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1413,['Lobsang']
"I'm sure there is, said Lu-Tze. I'm sure there is. There's the whole stretch under the trees, for one thing. And while we're on the subject, wonder boy, did you let that witch have her broomstick back?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1415,['Lu-Tze']
"Hah! said Lu-Tze, sweeping up a few more petals. Just like that. Just like that. So easily does a thief of time repay his debts!",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1417,['Lu-Tze']
"Lobsang must have caught the rebuke in the tone. He stared down at his feet. Well, perhaps not all of them, I admit, he said.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1418,['Lobsang']
"But when you have to save a world you cannot think of one person, you see, because one person is a part of that world, Lobsang went on.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1420,['Lobsang']
"It's amazing what a lady will understand, if you find the right way of putting it, said Lu-Tze. Best of luck, lad. You didn't do so bad, on the whole. And is it not written, There's no time like the present?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1423,['Lu-Tze']
"Lu-Tze went back to his sweeping. After a while, he smiled at a memory. An apprentice gives a gift to the master, eh? As if Lu-Tze could want anything that Time could give him",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1425,"['Lu-Tze', 'Lu-Tze']"
"In some place that had not existed before, and only existed now for this very purpose, stood a large, gleaming vat.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1428,[]
"Ten thousand gallons of delicate fondant sugar cream infused with essence of violet and stirred into dark chocolate, said Chaos. There are also strata of hazelnut praline in rich butter cream, and areas of soft caramel for that special touch of delight.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1429,[]
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THIS VAT COULD EXIST SOMEWHERE IN A TRULY INFINITE EVERYWHERE AND THEREFORE IT CAN EXIST HERE? said Death.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1430,"[""YOU'RE""]"
"IT MIGHT BE BEST, said Death, IF NEWS LIKE THAT DID NOT GET ABOUT. He walked back to where Unity was waiting in the darkness.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1438,[]
What else is there? said Unity. I have betrayed my own kind. And I am hideously insane. I can never be at home anywhere. And staying here would be an agony.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1440,[]
"Then she slipped out of her dress. To her amazement she felt embarrassed about doing so, but still drew herself up haughtily.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1442,[]
"Spoon, she commanded, and held out her right hand imperiously. Chaos gave a silver ladle a final, theatrical polish and passed it to her.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1443,[]
"The chocolate closed over her with barely a sound. Then the two watchers waited until the fat, lazy ripples had died away.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1446,[]
It was some minutes later that Death reached into his robe and pulled out a lifetimer that was small and light enough to have been designed for a doll. He turned round.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1459,[]
"Emma Robertson sat in the classroom with wrinkled brow, chewing on her pencil. Then, rather slowly, but with the air of one imparting great secrets, she set to work.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1463,['Emma Robertson']
We went to Lanker where there are witches they are kind they grow erbs. We met this which she was very jole and sang us a snog abot a hedghog it had dificut words. Jason try to kick her cat it chase him up a tre. I know a lot about wiches now they do not have warts they do not eat you they are just like your grane except your grane does not know difult words.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1465,"['jole', 'Jason']"
"At her high desk Susan relaxed. There was nothing like a classroom of bent heads. A good teacher used whatever materials there were to hand, and taking the class to visit Mrs Ogg was an education in herself. Two educations.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1466,"['Susan', 'Mrs Ogg']"
"A classroom going well had its own smell: a hint of pencil shavings, poster paints, long-dead stick insect, glue, and, of course, the faint aroma of Billy.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1467,['Billy']
"There had been an uneasy meeting with her grandfather. She'd raged that he hadn't told her things. And he'd said, of course he hadn't. If you told humans what the future held, it wouldn't. That made sense. Of course it made sense. It was good logic. The trouble was that Susan was only mostly logical. And so, now, things were back in that uneasy, rather cool state where they spent most of their time, in the tiny little family that ran on dysfunctionality.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1468,['Susan']
"Maybe, she thought, that was a normal family state in any case. When push came to shovethank you, Mrs Ogg, she'd always remember that phrase nowthey'd rely on each other automatically, without a thought. Apart from that, they kept out of one another's way.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1469,['Mrs Ogg']
"She hadn't seen the Death of Rats lately. It was too much to hope that he was dead. In any case, it hadn't slowed him down so far.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1470,[]
"That thought made her think about the contents of her desk. Susan was very strict about eating in class and took the view that, if there were rules, then they applied to everyone, even her. Otherwise they were merely tyranny. But rules were there to make you think before you broke them.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1471,['Susan']
"Opening the lid carefully and slipping her hand in was easy, and so was the maintenance of a suitably teachery face while she did so. Questing fingers found a chocolate in the nest of empty paper cups, and told her that it was a damn nougat. But she was resolute. Life was tough. Sometimes you got nougat.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1473,[]
"Then she briskly picked up the keys and walked to the Stationery Cupboard with what she hoped was the purposeful step of someone about to check on the supply of pencils. After all, you never knew, with pencils. They needed watching.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1474,[]
"The door clicked behind her, leaving only the dim light through the transom. She put the chocolate in her mouth and shut her eyes.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1475,[]
"They spilled out and whirled up into the shadows of the cupboard, brilliant against the darkness, a galaxy in miniature, gently spinning.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1477,[]
"At least, that was what she meant to say. The peculiar stickiness of the nougat caused it to come out as: Allite, you ot my fo' a'nen'on, oover ooah. Damn!",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1479,['Allite']
"4. An edge witch is one who makes her living on the edges, in that moment when boundary conditions applybetween life and death, light and dark, good and evil and, most dangerously of all, today and tomorrow.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1490,[]
"5. But they still use forks, or, at least, the idea of forks. There may, as the philosopher says, be no spoon, although this begs the question of why there is the idea of soup.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1491,[]
"6. And the story continues: The novice who had protested that it was only the shrine of a sweeper ran away from the temple, the student who said nothing remained a sweeper for the rest of his life; and the student who had seen the inevitable shape of the story went, after much agonizing and several months of meticulous sweeping, to Lu-Tze and knelt and asked to be shown the Right Way. Whereupon the Sweeper took him to the dojo of the Tenth Djim, with its terrible multi-bladed fighting machines and its fearsome serrated weapons such as the clong-clong and the uppsi. The story runs that the Sweeper then opened a cupboard at the back of the dojo and produced a broom and spake thusly: One hand here and the other here, understand? People never get it right. Use good, even strokes and let the broom do most of the work. Never try to sweep up a big pile, you'll end up sweeping every bit of dust twice. Use your dustpan wisely, and remember: a small brush for the corners.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1492,['Lu-Tze']
"7. One reason for this was the club food. At his club, a gentleman could find the kind of food he'd got used to at school, like spotted dick, jam roly-poly and that perennial favourite, stodge and custard. Vitamins are eaten by wives.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1493,[]
9. This is true. A chocolate you did not want to eat does not count as chocolate. This discovery is from the same branch of culinary physics that determined that food eaten while walking contains no calories.,14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1495,[]
"10. Not Did anything, just Did. Some things were Done, and some things were Not Done. And the things that were Done, Igors Did.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1496,[]
"11. Igors were loyal, but they were not stupid. A job was a job. When an employer had no further use for your services, for example because he'd just been staked through the heart by a crowd of angry villagers, it was time to move on before they decided that you ought to be on the next stake. An Igor soon learned a secret way out of any castle and where to stash an overnight bag. In the words of one of the founding Igors: We belong dead? Excuthe me? Where doeth it thay we?",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1497,[]
"12. And it has to be said that there was nothing intrinsically evil about Igors themselves. They just didn't pass judgement on other people. Admittedly, that was because if you worked for werewolves and vampires and people who looked on surgery as modern art rather than science, passing judgement would mean you'd never have time to get anything done.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1498,[]
"13. Every society needs a cry like that, but only in a very few do they come out with the complete, unvarnished version, which is Remember-the-Atrocity-Committed-Against-Us-Last-Time-That-Will-Excuse-the-Atrocity-That-We're-About-to-Commit-Today! And So On! Hurrah!",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1499,[]
"14. The yeti of the Ramtops, where the Discworld's magical field is so intense that it is part of the very landscape, are one of the few creatures to utilize control of personal time for genetic advantage. The result is a kind of physical premonitionyou find out what is going to happen next by allowing it to happen. Faced with danger, or any kind of task that involves risk of death, a yeti will save its life up to that point and then proceed with all due caution, yet in the comfortable knowledge that should everything go pancake-shaped, it will wake up at the point where it saved itself with, and this is the important part, knowledge of the events which have just happened but which will not now happen because it's not going to be such a damn fool next time. This is not quite the paradox it appears because, after it has taken place, it hasn't happened. All that actually remains is a memory in the yeti's head, which merely turns out to be a remarkably accurate premonition. The little eddies in time caused by all this are just lost in the noise of all the kinks, dips and knots put in time by every other living creature.",14_Thief of Time,0,"Chapter 2, verse 7, he said.",1500,[]
